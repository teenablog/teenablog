Thermal Conductivity PCM is a solid sheet at room temperature. When the device's operating temperature is reached, the material softens and covers the surface of the device to achieve a low thermal resistance TIM material. Phase change materials provide in rolls for ease of processing and assembly. It has better reliability than thermal grease. When the phase change temperature is reached, the material is fully phase changeable and can be used in very thin BLT designs.</p><p>
