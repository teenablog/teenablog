Metal organic framework materials or metal organic framework materials (English: Metal Organic Frameworks, abbreviation: MOF) is an important classification of new materials in metal organic materials (MOM). MOFs are one of the hottest areas of research in new inorganic-organic materials because they bring together inorganic and organic chemistry, two often separated chemical disciplines. MOFs consist of metal atoms or atomic clusters coordinated by organic ligands to form one-dimensional, two-dimensional or three-dimensional structures. MOFs can be used in gas adsorption, gas storage, gas separation, catalysts and other fields.</p><p>
