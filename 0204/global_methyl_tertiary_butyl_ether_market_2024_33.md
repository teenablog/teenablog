</p><p>Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) is a chemical compound primarily used as a gasoline additive to enhance fuel octane levels and reduce engine knocking. It is a colorless, flammable liquid with a distinctive odor, produced through the reaction of methanol with isobutene. Beyond its role in fuel, MTBE serves as a solvent in various industrial applications and as an intermediate in the production of other chemicals.â</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Market Dynamics</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Drivers</strong></p><p>
