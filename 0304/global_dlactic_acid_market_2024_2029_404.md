</p><p>D-Lactic Acid is a stereoisomer of L-Lactic Acid, which is the principal isomer produced by humans and responsible for most forms of lactic acidosis. D-Lactic Acid is produced by bacteria residing in the colon when carbohydrates are not completely absorbed in the small intestine. It is an uncommon disorder that can occur in patients with short bowel syndrome. Unlike L-Lactic Acid, which is an endogenous compound, D-Lactic Acid is a harmful enantiomer.</p><p>

* D-Lactic Acid has to be classified as a substance corrosive for the skin, based on a new recommendation from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). new classification implies that lactic acid should also fall under the ADR regulation where applicable. This classification does not apply to lactic acid salts (lactates).</p><p>
*Carbion is focusing on long-term decarbonization of the lactic acid process and the production of powder derivatives.</p><p>
* In Dec23, Corbion announced the mechanical completion of our new circular lactic acid manufacturing plant in Rayong, Thailand. Lactic acid produced by this first-of-its-kind facility will have the lowest associated carbon footprint compared to any manufacturing technologies currently used. The recycling of processing chemicals eliminates the use of lime, which is a significant contributor to our Scope III GHG emissions.</p><p>
