<h1>Pyrogenic Silica Powder Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Pyrogenic Silica Powder, also known as fumed silica, is an ultrafine, high-purity silicon dioxide (SiOâ) powder characterized by its unique properties, such as a high surface area, porosity, and excellent dispersion capabilities. It is produced through the flame hydrolysis of silicon tetrachloride, resulting in a highly reactive, amorphous form of silica. Pyrogenic silica is widely used across various industries as a thickening, anti-caking, reinforcing, and flow control agent. Its applications span coatings, adhesives, sealants, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and rubber processing.</p><p>
