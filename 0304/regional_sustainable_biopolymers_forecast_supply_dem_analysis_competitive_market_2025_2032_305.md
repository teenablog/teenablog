</p><p>Sustainable biopolymers are a category of polymers derived from renewable resources, designed to be biodegradable and environmentally friendly. These polymers undergo natural degradation after use, breaking down into non-toxic by-products such as water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, biomass, and inorganic salts. Unlike traditional plastics, which persist in the environment for centuries, sustainable biopolymers offer an alternative that reduces long-term pollution.</p><p>
</p><p>Biopolymers are commonly utilized in industries like packaging, agriculture, automotive, and healthcare due to their versatile applications and environmental benefits. These materials are produced from natural polymers such as starch, cellulose, proteins, and polylactic acid (PLA). The growing demand for biodegradable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics is a major driving force behind the expansion of the sustainable biopolymers market.</p><p>
