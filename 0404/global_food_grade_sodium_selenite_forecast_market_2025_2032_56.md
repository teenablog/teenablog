<h1>Food Grade Sodium Selenite Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Food Grade Sodium Selenite is a white crystalline, odorless compound that remains stable in air and is highly soluble in water but insoluble in ethanol. It plays a crucial role as an antioxidant, similar to vitamin E, by maintaining cell membrane integrity. As a key component of glutathione peroxidase, selenium helps neutralize lipid peroxidative free radicals, preventing cellular damage and oxidative stress. Food-grade sodium selenite is specifically formulated for safe inclusion in food products, providing essential dietary selenium.</p><p>
