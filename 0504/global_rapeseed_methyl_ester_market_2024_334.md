<h1>Global Rapeseed Methyl Ester Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>Report Overview
Methyl ester of rapeseed (RME) is a methyl ester mixture made up of saturated and unsaturated C16 to C22 fatty acids. Technically, methyl esters of rapeseed are produced by chemical conversion of rapeseed oil using methanol.RME is a clear, thin, combustible, non water-soluble liquid that gives off a faint smell.The principal constituents of methyl ester of rapeseed are oleic (55-65%), linoleic (18-25%), linolenic (5-11%) and palmitic acids (5-8%). Other fatty acids account for </p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
