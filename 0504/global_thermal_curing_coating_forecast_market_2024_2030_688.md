Thermal curing is a curing method that produces chemical crosslinking under the thermal action of heating or infrared radiation. According to different heating temperatures, it can be divided into low temperature curing, medium temperature curing and high temperature curing. Paint refers to the viscous liquid that can improve the decorative, protective and functional properties of the original object surface by spraying on the object surface, and forms a film after curing. It is usually composed of main resin, pigments (fillers), additives, solvents, etc.</p><p>
