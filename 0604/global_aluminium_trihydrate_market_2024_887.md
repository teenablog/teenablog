<h1>Aluminium Trihydrate (ATH) Market, Global Outlook &amp; Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Aluminium Trihydrate (ATH), also known as alumina trihydrate, is a key mineral produced synthetically from bauxite. It is a white crystalline substance commonly used as a flame retardant and smoke suppressant in various applications. ATH is particularly prized for its non-toxic and halogen-free properties, making it an environmentally friendly alternative in industries that require fire-resistant materials. The primary production method of ATH is through the Bayer process, where bauxite is refined to produce alumina, which is then hydrated to form ATH.</p><p>
