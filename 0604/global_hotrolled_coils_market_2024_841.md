<h1>Global Hot-Rolled Coils (HRC) Market Research Report 2024(Status and Outlook)</h1><p>Report Overview:
Hot rolling is a mill process which involves rolling the steel at a high temperature (typically at a temperature over 1702° F), which is above the steels recrystallization temperature. When steel is above the recrystallization temperature, it can be shaped and formed easily, and the steel can be made in much larger sizes. Hot rolled steel is typically cheaper than cold rolled steel due to the fact that it is often manufactured without any delays in the process, and therefore the reheating of the steel is not required (as it is with cold rolled). When the steel cools off it will shrink slightly thus giving less control on the size and shape of the finished product when compared to cold rolled.
Hot Rolled Coils refers to the rolling of flat rolled sheet and coil products.
