Copper alloys for lead frames are roughly divided into copper-iron series, copper-nickel-silicon series, copper-chromium series, copper-nickel-tin series (JK--2 alloy), etc., ternary, quaternary and other multi-element copper alloys It can achieve better performance and lower cost than traditional binary alloys. There are the most grades of copper-iron alloys. It has good mechanical strength, stress relaxation resistance and low creep. It is a very good type of lead. frame material. Due to the needs of lead frame production and packaging applications, in addition to high strength and high thermal conductivity, the material is also required to have good brazing performance, process performance, etching performance, and oxide film adhesion performance. Materials are developed in the direction of high strength, high conductivity, and low cost. A small amount of various elements are added to copper to improve the strength of the alloy (making the lead frame less likely to deform) and comprehensive performance without significantly reducing the electrical conductivity. Materials with a strength above 600Mpa and a conductivity greater than 80%IACS are research and development hotspots.
