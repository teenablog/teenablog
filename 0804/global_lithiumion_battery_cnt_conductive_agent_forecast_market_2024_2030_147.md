The current preparation methods of CNT mainly include chemical vapor deposition (CVD), laser evaporation, graphite arc method, and hydrothermal method. However, due to the shortcomings of high cost and difficulty in industrial production for the latter three, CNT manufacturers use choose to use CVD. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) and single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), are employed as conductive additives in lithium ion batteries. CNT paste is a new highly efficient conductive agent for Li-ion Battery, which can replace the traditional conductive agents such as carbon black, graphite &amp; carbon fibre. It has some excellent characteristics of high LD ratio, big SSA value &amp; low volume resistivity, can be used in various specifications of electrode materials, such as LFP, LCO, LMN, NCM, graphite, etc.</p><p>
