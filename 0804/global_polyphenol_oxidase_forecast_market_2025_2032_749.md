<h1>Polyphenol Oxidase Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Polyphenol Oxidase (PPO) is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of polyphenols into quinones, leading to browning in fruits, vegetables, and other plant-based products. It plays a crucial role in food processing, agriculture, and biotechnology. In the food industry, PPO inhibitors are used to prevent undesirable browning, while in agriculture, the enzymeâ€™s properties are harnessed for crop protection and quality enhancement.</p><p>
