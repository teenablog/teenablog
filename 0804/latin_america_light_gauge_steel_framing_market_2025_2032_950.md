<h1>Latin America Light Gauge Steel Framing Market Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Light gauge steel framing (LGSF) refers to the use of cold-formed steel (CFS) elements in construction, typically within thickness ranges of 0.8mm to 2.5mm. These components include structural wall studs, floor joists, roof rafters, and trusses, which are fabricated with high precision to ensure consistent quality. Unlike conventional steel structures, LGSF is lightweight yet robust, offering superior strength-to-weight ratios, ease of handling, and efficient assembly. The system is widely used in residential, commercial, and industrial construction due to its durability, fire resistance, and adaptability to various architectural designs.</p><p>
