<h1>Polyglycolic Acid Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p><strong>The global Polyglycolic Acid market was valued at US$ 411.3 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 642.4 million by 2030, exhibiting a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 6.7% during the forecast period (2023-2030).</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Polyglycolide or poly(glycolic acid) (PGA), also spelled as polyglycolic acid is a biodegradable, semi-crystalline thermoplastic. It is also the simplest linear, aliphatic polyester. PGA resins are known for their excellent gas barrier properties, relative high strength, and excellent biodegradability. Some grades have a biodegradation rate similar to cellulose and decompose under composting conditions into CO2 and water within one month.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

PGA and its copolymers such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), and poly(glycolide-co-caprolactone) are used in a number of applications. Due to PGA's very low permeability to O2 and CO2, it can be used as a packaging film for oxygen sensitive products, for example as an interlayer between two polyester films. Other important applications include shale gas extraction and other industrial processes as well as synthetic fast absorbable sutures for internal surgeries.</p><p>
