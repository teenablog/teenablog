</p><p><strong>Globally, the market has seen significant growth over the past decade due to the increasing demand for electric motors in the automotive, consumer electronics, and industrial automation sectors. The expansion of power distribution networks in developing nations and a sharp focus on green energy alternatives have further fueled demand.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong><strong>Electric steel</strong>, also known as <strong>silicon steel</strong>, <strong>lamination steel</strong>, <strong>relay steel</strong>, or <strong>transformer steel</strong>, is a specialty alloy comprising primarily <strong>iron</strong> and <strong>silicon</strong>. This material is engineered to exhibit enhanced magnetic properties, making it essential for energy-efficient magnetism and electricity conversion. The core purpose of electric steel is to serve as a <strong>functional material</strong> in electrical applications that rely heavily on magnetic flux.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Electric steel sheets are typically categorized into grain-oriented electrical steel (GOES) and non-oriented electrical steel (NOES):</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Grain-Oriented Electrical Steel (GOES): Characterized by its highly aligned grain structure, this type is optimized for low core loss in one direction and is predominantly used in transformers, particularly in the power and distribution sectors.</strong></p><p><strong>Non-Oriented Electrical Steel (NOES): With grains arranged randomly, NOES delivers uniform magnetic properties in all directions, making it suitable for rotating machinery such as motors and generators.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Electric steel plays a vital role in minimizing energy losses in electrical devices and contributes directly to the enhancement of energy efficiency and sustainability in infrastructure, industrial machinery, and mobility solutions.</strong></p><p>
