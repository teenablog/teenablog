</p><p>Exposed aggregate surface retarder is a chemical substance or product used in concrete construction to create decorative concrete surfaces with exposed aggregate. These surfaces are characterized by the exposure of the aggregate (such as gravel, pebbles, or decorative stones) embedded in the concrete matrix. The retarder is applied to the concrete surface to slow down the curing process of the cement paste on the surface while allowing the underlying concrete to cure normally. This delayed curing enables the top layer to be washed away or removed, revealing the decorative aggregate beneath.</p><p>
