</p><p><strong>Historical data indicates consistent growth, with the market expanding from approximately USD 560 million in 2018 to USD 685 million in 2023. Technological advancements, increased awareness regarding sustainability, and the integration of composite materials in both new constructions and retrofitting projects are expected to further bolster market expansion.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>Fiber Reinforced Thermoset Composites for Construction refer to engineered materials composed of reinforcing fibers—most commonly glass fibers—embedded within a thermosetting resin matrix. These composites combine the superior mechanical properties of fibers with the durability and chemical resistance of thermoset resins. Common thermosetting resins used include epoxy, polyester, and vinyl ester. The result is a lightweight yet highly durable material with superior tensile strength, corrosion resistance, and thermal stability, making it ideal for construction applications.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>These composites are widely used in structural components, reinforcement of concrete, bridge decks, wall panels, beams, and other load-bearing or corrosive-environment infrastructure. Their ability to be custom-molded into complex shapes, along with resistance to moisture, UV radiation, and chemicals, makes them a superior alternative to traditional materials such as steel, wood, or pure concrete in many construction environments.</strong></p><p>
