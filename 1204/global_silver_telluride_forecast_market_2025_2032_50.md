<h1>Silver Telluride Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Silver telluride is a chemical compound made up of silver and tellurium. It occurs naturally as the mineral hessite, which is primarily composed of silver (I) telluride (AgâTe), and it can also form as silver (II) telluride, known as empressite. The compound can be found in different stoichiometries, with silver (I) telluride (AgâTe) being the most common, although metastable compounds such as silver (II) telluride (AgTe) and AgâTeâ also exist.</p><p>
</p><p>Silver telluride has semiconducting properties, meaning it can conduct electricity under certain conditions. Notably, silver telluride can be doped both n-type and p-type, making it versatile for use in various electronic applications. In its stoichiometric form, AgâTe generally exhibits n-type conductivity. When silver is lost from the material, its electrical properties change, and non-stoichiometric silver telluride has been observed to demonstrate extraordinary magnetoresistance. This makes silver telluride an important material in fields like thermoelectrics, semiconductor technology, and even magnetoresistive devices.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
