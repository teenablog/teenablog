<h1>Electric Fused Quartz Ingot Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Electric fusion is the most commonly used melting process for manufacturing quartz glass. This process uses resistance heaters to melt natural quartz sand into quartz glass tubes, rods, blocks, etc. There are two methods of electric fusion, continuous fusion, and batch fusion. In the continuous process, quartz sand is continuously poured into the upper part of a tungsten crucible surrounded by electric heating elements. The inside crucible is maintained in a neutral or slightly reduced atmosphere that keeps silica from reacting with the refractory metal while the silica is melted inside.</p><p>
