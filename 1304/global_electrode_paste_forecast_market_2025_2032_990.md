</p><p><strong>Electrode paste, also known as self-baking electrode or SÃ¶derberg electrode paste, is a conductive material used in electric arc furnaces for the production of various ferrous and non-ferrous alloys. It is composed of calcined petroleum coke, calcined anthracite, coal tar pitch, and other additives. This paste undergoes a self-baking process within the furnace, transforming from a paste into a solid carbon electrode. The electrode paste offers excellent thermal and electrical conductivity, high mechanical strength, and resistance to oxidation, essential for stable furnace operations.</strong></p><p>
