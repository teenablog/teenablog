<h1>Pharmaceutical Pregelatinized Starch Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Pharmaceutical pregelatinized starch is a modified starch obtained through chemical or mechanical processes that partially or fully break down starch granules. It is widely used as a binder, diluent, and disintegrant in pharmaceutical tablets, providing enhanced compressibility and solubility. Due to its self-lubricating properties, it reduces friction during tablet manufacturing. However, when combined with other excipients, additional lubricants like magnesium stearate are recommended. While non-toxic and non-irritating in controlled dosages, excessive intake can be harmful.</p><p>
