</p><p>The Europe market for Global Sodium Metasilicate Anhydrous market is estimated to increase from USD million in 2022 to reach USD million by 2030, at a CAGR during the forecast period of 2023 through 2030.</p><p>
Industrial Grade Segment to Reach $ Million by 2030, with a % CAGR in next six years.</p><p>
The global key manufacturers of Sodium Metasilicate Anhydrous include Silmaco, Jay Dinesh Chemicals, Aqua Bond Inc, DuPont, APC Pure, Oakwood Products, Inc, Nama Group, Diatom and Shijiazhuang Donghao Chemical Research Institute Co., Ltd., etc. in 2023, the global top five players have a share approximately % in terms of revenue.</p><p>
The molecular formula of anhydrous sodium metasilicate is Na2SiO3, the pH value is about 12.4, and the melting point is 1089Â°C.</p><p>
The density is 0.8-1.2g/cm3, the dissolution rate in water is fast, and there will be no vitrification phenomenon. The application performance of anhydrous sodium metasilicate is better than hydrated silicon metasilicate in some fields.</p><p>
Anhydrous sodium metasilicate has uniform particles, large specific surface area, and high oil absorption value, which is beneficial to remove oil stains; the total alkali and total silica content of anhydrous sodium metasilicate is ?94%, which improves the resistance to Ca compared with hydrated silicon metasilicate. , The binding capacity of Mg ions plays an important role in promoting hard water softening, adjusting and stabilizing PH value, improving surfactant performance, improving detergency, dispersing eluted dirt and maintaining a good powder structure. Anhydrous sodium metasilicate will not precipitate crystal water, and it shows special compatibility and stability to organochlorine, peroxide, bleach synergist, etc. in detergents, and its builder effect is obviously better than hydrated silicon metasilicate and 4A Zeolite. Based on the fact that anhydrous sodium metasilicate has a relatively strong ability to complex magnesium ions, and 4A zeolite has a relatively strong ability to complex calcium ions, so in the anhydrous sodium metasilicate-4A zeolite binary additive, the advantages of the two complement each other and have sufficient The ability to chelate calcium and magnesium ions has excellent performance on the synergistic effect of surfactants. Foreign washing powder and washing powder processed by Chinese enterprises for foreign countries will add a large amount of anhydrous sodium metasilicate.</p><p>
