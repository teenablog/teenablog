</p><p>Dimethyl esters, or DMEs, are organic compounds that are used as solvents in a variety of industrial and specialty applications. They are readily biodegradable, low odor, and low VOC (volatile organic compound) solvents. Dimethyl ether (DME) is a colorless gas that is used as a precursor to other organic compounds and as an aerosol propellant in fuel applications. Dimethoxyethane (DME), also known as glyme or monoglyme, is a colorless liquid ether used as a solvent, particularly in lithium batteries. Dimethyl carbonate (DMC) is an organic compound used as a methylating agent and co-solvent in lithium-ion batteries. Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT) is an organic compound used in the production of polyesters. Overall, dimethyl esters and related compounds have a wide range of applications in the chemical industry.</p><p>
