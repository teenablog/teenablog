</p><p><strong>Ethoxyquinoline, commonly known as ethoxyquin, is a synthetic antioxidant prominently used in animal feed and industrial applications due to its excellent preservative properties. Its trade names include Sandaoquin and Hupiling, while the chemical nomenclature is 6-ethoxy-1,2-dihydro-2,2,4-trimethylquinoline. The compound is synthesized through a condensation reaction involving p-aminophenetole and acetone in the presence of a catalyst. Earlier methods relied on hydrogen halides, but recent processes utilize sulfonic acids such as benzenesulfonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or cresolsulfonic acid to ensure a safer and more environmentally friendly production route.</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>This antioxidant plays a vital role in preserving the quality of feed, particularly in aquaculture and poultry, by preventing the oxidation of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Furthermore, its stabilizing effects in industrial rubber and chemical processes contribute to its global demand.</strong></p><p>
