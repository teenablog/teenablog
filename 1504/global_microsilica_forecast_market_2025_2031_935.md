Demand is also being fueled by the rising awareness of microsilica’s ability to enhance the sustainability and longevity of concrete in harsh environments.</p><p>
</p><p>Historically, the microsilica market has shown steady growth, with increased use in both developed and emerging economies. The growing focus on eco-friendly construction materials and energy-efficient buildings is likely to bolster further adoption.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Silica fume</strong>, also known as <strong>microsilica</strong> or <strong>ultrafine silica</strong>, is a by-product derived from the production of silicon metal or ferrosilicon alloys in electric arc furnaces. It appears as a gray or white powder and consists of extremely fine, amorphous silicon dioxide (SiOâ) particles. The typical particle diameter of silica fume is less than 1 micron, with an average size of about 0.15 microns—approximately 100 times smaller than cement particles. This fine structure imparts high pozzolanic activity to microsilica, making it an effective additive in cement and concrete applications.</p><p>
</p><p>Microsilica enhances the mechanical properties and durability of concrete, leading to increased strength, reduced permeability, and improved resistance to sulfate attack and alkali-silica reaction. Due to these benefits, it is extensively used in infrastructure projects, high-performance concrete, refractory materials, and oil well grouting.</p><p>
