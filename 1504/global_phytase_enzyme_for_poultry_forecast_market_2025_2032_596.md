<h1>Phytase Enzyme for Poultry Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Phytase is a crucial enzyme widely used in poultry feed to enhance phosphorus availability from plant-based sources. It helps in breaking down <strong>phytic acid</strong>, a naturally occurring anti-nutrient in grains and oilseeds, into more digestible forms of phosphorus.</p><p>
</p><p>Derived primarily from microbial sources such as Pichia pastoris, phytase is available in different formulations, including granular, powder, liquid, and thermostable forms. By supplementing poultry diets with phytase, farmers can <strong>enhance nutrient utilization, reduce feed costs, and minimize phosphorus excretion into the environment</strong>, addressing both economic and ecological concerns.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
