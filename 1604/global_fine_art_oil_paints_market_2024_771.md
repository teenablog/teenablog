This creates intense price competition and often makes it difficult for new entrants to differentiate themselves effectively.</p><p><strong>Fluctuating Raw Material Prices</strong>: The volatility in the prices of raw materials like linseed oil and pigments has a direct impact on the overall cost structure of oil paints. This can affect profitability for manufacturers and make price stability difficult.</p><p><strong>Changing Art Preferences</strong>: Shifting trends in the art world, including the increasing popularity of digital and mixed media art, can reduce the overall demand for traditional oil painting materials.</p><p>
