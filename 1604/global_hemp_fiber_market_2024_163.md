<h1>Hemp Fiber Market, Global Outlook &amp; Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Hemp fiber is a natural, biodegradable material derived from the stalk of the hemp plant. It consists of two primary types: long bast fibers and short core fibers. Bast fibers resemble softwood fibers, offering strength and flexibility, while core fibers are more akin to hardwood fibers, making them suitable for industrial applications. Hemp fiber is widely used across industries, including textiles, pulp &amp; paper, and composite materials, due to its durability, sustainability, and versatility.</p><p>
