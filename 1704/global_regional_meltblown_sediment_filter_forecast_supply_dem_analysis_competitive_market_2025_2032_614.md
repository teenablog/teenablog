</p><p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Melt-blown filters utilize depth gradients to remove sediment from water. These filters are made by blowing high-velocity gas through molten polymer, which forms intricately layered fibers. The inner core of melt-blown filters is denser than the outer core, so as water is processed through the filter walls, the filter is able to clarify increasingly finer particulate. The graded density of melt-blown filters, also known as spun filters, can filter down below 10 microns. They are ideal for filtering very fine particulate. Melt-blown filters are adept at filtering particulate of varying micron sizes because of their gradation.</p><p>
