</p><p><strong>Food-grade ethanol alcohol, also known as food-grade ethyl alcohol or drinking alcohol, is a purified form of ethanol that meets stringent safety and quality standards for use in food, beverage, and pharmaceutical applications. Produced via fermentation of natural sources such as potatoes, cereals, or sugar, followed by distillation and rectification, food-grade ethanol is characterized by its high purity and absence of harmful contaminants. It is primarily used in the production of alcoholic beverages, flavor extracts, vinegar, food colorings, and preservatives. In the food industry, its flavor is influenced by aldehydes, acids, esters, and other compounds, contributing to the overall organoleptic profile of liquors.</strong></p><p>
