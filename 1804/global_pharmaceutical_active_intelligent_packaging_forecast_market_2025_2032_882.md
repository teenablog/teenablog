<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Pharmaceutical active and intelligent packaging refers to packaging systems that are designed to interact with the environment to monitor or control conditions within the packaging to enhance the shelf life, stability, and safety of pharmaceutical products. These packaging technologies can detect changes in factors such as temperature, humidity, oxygen levels, and light, helping to prolong the efficacy of drugs. Active packaging utilizes substances like desiccants, oxygen scavengers, or antimicrobial agents that work in real-time to preserve the product. Intelligent packaging, on the other hand, incorporates sensors and indicators that communicate information such as temperature excursions, humidity changes, and expiry dates to manufacturers and consumers.</p><p>
</p><p>With the rapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry, the demand for packaging solutions that extend the life of drugs while ensuring they remain safe for consumption is higher than ever. These advanced packaging systems are increasingly being implemented to safeguard the quality and effectiveness of medicines, reduce spoilage, and minimize counterfeit issues.</p><p>
