</p><p>With over <strong>95%</strong> of the market comprising <strong>inorganic pigments</strong>, titanium dioxide stands out as the most widely used pigment due to its high opacity and brightness. Regionally, <strong>China accounts for approximately 51%</strong> of global demand, driven by rapid industrialization and infrastructure development. Europe and North America follow as significant markets due to high consumption in automotive and construction sectors.</p><p>
</p><p>The surge in demand for eco-friendly, non-toxic, and sustainable pigments is further contributing to market expansion. Additionally, urbanization, rising disposable incomes, and technological advancements in pigment dispersion and colorfastness are supporting long-term growth across applications.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Pigments</strong> are finely ground natural or synthetic substances that impart color to materials. These are widely used in various industries, including paints, coatings, plastics, inks, textiles, cosmetics, and construction. Pigments can be broadly categorized into inorganic pigments and organic pigments. Inorganic pigments, such as titanium dioxide and iron oxide, are known for their durability, UV resistance, and opacity, while organic pigments offer vibrant hues and superior tinting strength but are generally less resistant to weather and heat.</p><p>
</p><p>The global pigments market serves a critical role in enhancing product aesthetics, functionality, and brand recognition across diverse sectors. In recent years, there has been a significant shift toward eco-friendly and sustainable pigments due to environmental concerns and regulatory compliance, especially in developed markets. This evolving demand is driving innovations in pigment chemistry and application techniques, positioning pigments as both a functional and aesthetic necessity in industrial and consumer products.</p><p>
