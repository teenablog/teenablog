<h1>Polyurethane Adhesive for Power Batteries Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Polyurethane adhesives offer a robust combination of strength and flexibility, making them essential for applications requiring durability. In the power battery sector, these adhesives play a critical role in assembling battery packs for electric and hybrid vehicles. They are available in one-component and two-component formulations and exhibit excellent adhesion properties. However, their performance may degrade at prolonged high temperatures above 302°F (150°C). Their chemical resistance and mechanical stability make them ideal for use in electric vehicle (EV) battery assembly, ensuring secure bonding and structural integrity.</p><p>
