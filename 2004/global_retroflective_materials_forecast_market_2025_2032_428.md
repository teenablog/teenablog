<h1>Retroflective Materials (RRMs) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Retroflective Materials (RRMs) are engineered to reflect light back to its source, enhancing visibility in low-light conditions. These materials are composed of tiny retroreflective elements, such as glass beads or microprismatic structures, embedded within a film, sheeting, or paint. Common applications include traffic signs, road markings, construction work zone products, and safety gear. RRMs play a crucial role in road safety, infrastructure development, and personal protective equipment (PPE) due to their high visibility attributes.</p><p>
