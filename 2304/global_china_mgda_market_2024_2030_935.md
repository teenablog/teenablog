MGDA (Methylglycinediacetic acid) is a readily biodegradable chelating agent used in various applications, including detergents, cleaning products, and industrial processes, offering high performance and environmental friendliness.</p><p>
China's MGDA market is growing rapidly, driven by increasing demand for eco-friendly chelating agents, stricter environmental regulations, and expanding applications in various industries. In 2023, China produced approximately 18,500 metric tons of MGDA, with 75% consumed domestically and 25% exported. The cleaning and detergent sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 55% of demand, followed by water treatment at 25% and industrial processes at 15%. The market saw a significant boost from China's push towards phosphate-free detergents, leading to a 40% increase in MGDA adoption in household and industrial cleaning formulations in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving production efficiency and product purity, with new processes achieving 99% purity levels while reducing energy consumption by 25% compared to 2020 methods. The market is seeing strong growth in water treatment applications, increasing at 15% annually, driven by MGDA's excellent performance in scale inhibition and metal sequestration. In 2023, new regulations on industrial wastewater treatment led to a 30% increase in the use of MGDA in metal plating and paper manufacturing industries. The industry faces challenges from price competition with other chelating agents, but MGDA's superior biodegradability and versatility continue to drive its adoption. Emerging applications in agriculture are showing promise, with MGDA for micronutrient chelation in fertilizers growing at 20% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 3% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China's growing emphasis on circular economy principles, with MGDA for recycling and resource recovery applications projected to grow at 12% CAGR through 2030.</p><p>
