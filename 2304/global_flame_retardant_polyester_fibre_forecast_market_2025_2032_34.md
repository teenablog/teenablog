</p><p>The market's expansion is driven by stringent fire safety regulations, increasing applications in textiles, and growing demand in public and industrial sectors.</p><p>
<strong>Market Size</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Flame Retardant Polyester Fibre (FRPF) is a specialized type of polyester staple fiber (PSF) engineered to resist ignition and slow down the spread of flames. These fibers are manufactured from purified terephthalic acid (PTA) and monoethylene glycol (MEG) or PET chips, with additional flame retardant chemicals integrated into the polymer matrix. FRPF is widely utilized across various industries, including clothing, home textiles, public utilities, and industrial applications, where fire resistance is a crucial safety feature.</p><p>
<strong>Market Dynamics</strong></p><p>
