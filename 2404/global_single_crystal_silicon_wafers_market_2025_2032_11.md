</p><p><strong>Single crystal silicon wafers (300mm)</strong> are high-purity, ultra-flat silicon discs used as substrates in semiconductor manufacturing. These wafers serve as the foundation for integrated circuits (ICs), which power devices such as computers, smartphones, automotive systems, and industrial electronics. The 300mm diameter wafer is the industry standard for high-volume production, offering cost efficiency and greater yield compared to smaller wafer sizes.</p><p>
</p><p>Single crystal silicon wafers are manufactured through a process known as the <strong>Czochralski (CZ) method</strong>, where a single silicon crystal is grown from a molten silicon bath and sliced into thin wafers. These wafers undergo various treatments, including doping, etching, and polishing, to meet the precise electrical and mechanical specifications required for semiconductor applications.</p><p>
