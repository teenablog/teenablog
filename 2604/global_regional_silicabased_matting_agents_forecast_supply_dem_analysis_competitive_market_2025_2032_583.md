</p><p><strong>Report Overview</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Matting agents help control the gloss of the surface on which they are applied. These agents are fine particles that are dispersed in paint and coating formulations in such a way that they scatter the light falling on the surface in a desired, defined manner. This helps achieve matte finish or reduce the gloss of the surface on which they are applied. Silica is a major raw material that is used in the manufacture of matting agents.</p><p>
