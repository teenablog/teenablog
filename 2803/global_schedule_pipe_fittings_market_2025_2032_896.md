</p><p>Compared to Schedule 40 fittings, Schedule 80 fittings feature thicker walls, which provide enhanced durability and pressure resistance. Their pressure ratings vary based on size and material, ranging from 850 PSI for smaller sizes (e.g., ¼ inch) to around 250 PSI for larger sizes (e.g., 24 inches). These fittings are essential for transporting liquids and gases in environments where high-pressure performance and corrosion resistance are critical.</p><p>
