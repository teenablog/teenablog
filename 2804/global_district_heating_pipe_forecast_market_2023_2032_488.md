<h1>District Heating Pipe Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>District heating, also known as heat networks or teleheating, is a system for distributing heat from a centralized source through a network of insulated pipes for residential, commercial, and industrial heating applications. These systems typically source heat from cogeneration plants using fossil fuels, biomass, heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating, solar heating, heat pumps, or waste heat from industrial processes, including nuclear power generation. The primary advantage of district heating is its high efficiency and superior pollution control compared to localized heating solutions.</p><p>
