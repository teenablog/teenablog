<h1>Electrical Steel Coil Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>
</p><p>Electrical Steel, also known as silicon steel, is a ferrosilicon soft magnetic alloy steel with very low carbon content, usually containing 0.5% to 4.5% silicon. The global Electrical Steel Coil market size was estimated at USD 31,560 million in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 50,233.37 million by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.30% during the forecast period. In North America, the Electrical Steel Coil market size was estimated at USD 8,987.78 million in 2023, with a CAGR of 4.54% during the forecast period from 2024 to 2032.</p><p>
Electrical Steel Coil refers to a ferrosilicon soft magnetic alloy steel with low carbon content and high silicon content. It includes two major categories: grain-oriented and non-oriented electrical steel. Grain-oriented steel is ideal for transformer applications due to its low core loss, high permeability, and low magnetostriction. Non-oriented steel, with random grain orientation, is commonly used in the motor industry.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
