</p><p>Scrap metals are sourced from a variety of industries, including automotive, construction, electronics, and manufacturing. These metals are typically separated into ferrous (iron and steel) and non-ferrous (aluminum, copper, lead, etc.) categories before being processed into new forms. Recycling processes involve melting, refining, and alloying to create usable raw materials that can be used in new products.</p><p>
</p><p>In addition to helping conserve natural resources, metal recycling reduces the energy required to produce new metals, significantly lowering greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, it provides economic value by supplying affordable raw materials for manufacturers.</p><p>
