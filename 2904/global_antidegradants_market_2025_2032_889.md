</p><p>Antidegradants are substances used in the production of rubber products, including tires, to prevent or slow down the degradation process caused by factors like heat, light, air, and mechanical wear. These agents help extend the lifespan of rubber, particularly in tires, which are constantly subjected to harsh environmental and physical conditions.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @

</p><p>Rubber, over time, loses its elasticity, tensile strength, and overall durability due to the continuous exposure to ozone, UV radiation, and oxidation. To mitigate this process, manufacturers incorporate a range of chemicals known as antioxidants and antiozonants. Antioxidants help counteract the harmful effects of oxygen and heat, while antiozonants specifically target ozone degradation, which is a leading cause of rubber aging.</p><p>
</p><p>Market Size</p><p>
</p><p>The automotive sector is the largest consumer of rubber products, with tires representing a significant portion of the demand. As the global automotive market continues to expand, so does the need for high-quality tires that can withstand extreme weather conditions and wear over time. Additionally, the rapid industrialization and urbanization in emerging economies are fueling the growth of rubber usage in construction materials, infrastructure, and other industrial products.</p><p>
</p><p>Historically, the market has experienced steady growth, largely due to the increasing awareness of the benefits of using antidegradants to improve the performance and longevity of rubber products. This trend is expected to continue as more manufacturers focus on developing advanced antidegradant formulations and as regulatory standards for product quality and safety become more stringent.</p><p>
