<strong>Definition</strong></p><p>
</p><p>Food grade potassium metabisulfite is a chemical compound used in the food and beverage industry as a preservative, antioxidant, and disinfectant. It is a white, crystalline powder that is soluble in water. Potassium metabisulfite, with the chemical formula K2S2O5, is made up of potassium, sulfur, and oxygen. It releases sulfur dioxide (SO2) when dissolved in water. This sulfur dioxide has antimicrobial properties and can inhibit the growth of bacteria, yeasts, and molds, extending the shelf life of various food and beverage products.</p><p>
