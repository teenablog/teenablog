<h1>Nusinersen Market, Global Outlook &amp; Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Nusinersen is a groundbreaking medication used for treating spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy. This drug works by modifying the expression of the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene, which is deficient in SMA patients. It is administered via an intrathecal injection, directly into the spinal canal, ensuring efficient delivery to the central nervous system. Approved by regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA, Nusinersen has transformed SMA treatment, significantly improving patient outcomes and mobility.</p><p>
