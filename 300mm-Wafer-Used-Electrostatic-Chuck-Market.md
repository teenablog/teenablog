The global 300mm Wafer Used Electrostatic Chuck market was valued at US$ 1328.8 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 1984.3 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 5.9% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

An electrostatic chuck is a component inside semiconductor equipment that is used to hold the semiconductor wafer. In the IoT Society, the demand for semiconductor is growing, which in turn has led to annual increases in the need for installing semiconductor-manufacturing equipment.

A 300mm wafer refers to a silicon wafer used in semiconductor manufacturing that has a diameter of 300 millimeters (11.8 inches). An electrostatic chuck (ESC) is a device used to hold the wafer in place during various processing steps.

In semiconductor manufacturing, the electrostatic chuck plays a critical role in securing the wafer to ensure precise positioning and stability during processes such as deposition, etching, and lithography. The chuck holds the wafer using the principle of electrostatic attraction.

Typically, an ESC consists of a flat metal plate with an insulating layer on top. The insulating layer is usually made of ceramic materials like aluminum oxide (Al2O3) or aluminum nitride (AlN). The insulator prevents the flow of electricity through the chuck, except for specific regions.

Electrodes are embedded within the chuck, usually underneath the insulating layer. By applying a high-voltage direct current (DC) to these electrodes, an electric field is generated, which in turn creates an electrostatic force. This force attracts the wafer and holds it firmly against the chuckâ€™s surface.

The advantage of using an electrostatic chuck is that it provides good thermal conductivity to control the wafer temperature during processing. Additionally, it enables uniform clamping across the entire surface of the wafer, minimizing any warpage or distortion.

The use of a 300mm wafer in conjunction with an electrostatic chuck is common in advanced semiconductor fabrication facilities. The larger wafer size allows for higher production throughput and increased device yield, as more individual chips can be fabricated on a single wafer.
