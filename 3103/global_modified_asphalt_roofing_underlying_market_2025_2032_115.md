<h1>Modified Asphalt Roofing Underlying Market Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Modified asphalt roofing underlayment is a specialized material used in roofing applications to provide a secondary barrier against water infiltration. It is often rubberized or modified with elastomers to enhance flexibility, durability, and waterproofing performance. A distinctive feature of these underlayments is the selvedge edge, designed to create a watertight seal when overlapping rolls during installation. When applied in courses across a roof, the selvedge edge should always be positioned along the top edge to ensure maximum efficacy.</p><p>
