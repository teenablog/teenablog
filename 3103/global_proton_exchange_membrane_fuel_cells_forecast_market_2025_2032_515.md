<h1>Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) Fuel Cells Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), also known as polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, are electrochemical devices that generate electricity through the reaction of hydrogen and oxygen, producing only water and heat as byproducts. These fuel cells operate at relatively low temperatures (50 to 100°C) and use a solid polymer as an electrolyte. They are primarily used in transportation, stationary, and portable power applications due to their high efficiency, rapid startup, and environmental benefits.</p><p>
