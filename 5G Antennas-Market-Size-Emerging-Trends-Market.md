key trends shaping the 5G antennas market:

Shift toward new frequency spectrum – 5G networks operate on higher mmWave frequencies of 24 GHz to 72 GHz spectrum enabling faster data speeds. This requires new antenna designs for this high frequency range.
Smaller form factors – As 5G infrastructure gets deployed across miniaturized embedded devices and mobile terminals, manufacturers are focusing on developing compact, lightweight antenna solutions.
Massive MIMO antennas – Large scale deployment of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) antennas supporting beamforming and spatial multiplexing techniques to boost network capacity and minimize interference.
Multi-band/Multi-frequency antennas – Single 5G antennas supporting operation across wider frequency spectrums ranging from legacy sub-6 GHz signals as well as upcoming mmWave frequencies.
Embedded Antenna Systems – Innovation in integrating antenna arrays within 5G equipment and hardware itself allowing for novel form factors suited for urban small cell deployment.
Use of new materials like meta-surfaces – Adoption of metamaterials consisting of repeat cell structures for building innovative beam-steering antennas for 5G networks.
