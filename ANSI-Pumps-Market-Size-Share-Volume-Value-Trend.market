The ANSI Pump market has been experiencing continual growth for the past several years. The global market for ANSI Pump is expected to reach a significant valuation by the end of the year of assessment, to reflect a value of over US$ 2.18 billion by 2029. The global ANSI Pump market is projected to expand at a value CAGR of 4.19% throughout the period of assessment, 2023-2029. This expansion can be attributed to the increasing demand of recovery from the pandemic.



ANSI pumps, also known as ANSI standard pumps, refer to a specific type of centrifugal pump that conforms to the standards set by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). The ANSI standard for pumps, specifically ASME B73.1, provides guidelines for the design, construction, and performance of centrifugal pumps used in industrial applications.

The term "ANSI pump" typically refers to a centrifugal pump that adheres to the dimensional and operational standards specified by the ANSI B73.1 standard. These pumps are commonly used in industries such as chemical processing, oil and gas, power generation, water treatment, and more.



The ANSI standard ensures interchangeability and compatibility between different pump manufacturers. It establishes standard dimensions for mounting, shaft, impeller, and casing sizes, as well as standardizing performance parameters such as flow rate, head pressure, and temperature limits.



The purpose of adhering to ANSI standards is to provide a consistent and reliable framework for pump selection, installation, and maintenance. ANSI pumps are known for their durability, efficiency, and ease of maintenance due to the standardized design and interchangeability of components.
