The ArF excimer laser is a type of ultraviolet laser that uses an argon–fluoride (ArF) gas mixture. These lasers are used in a variety of applications, such as microfabrication, micromachining, and medical device manufacturing.



The ArF excimer laser is a type of ultraviolet laser that is used in a number of industries, including the semiconductor industry, for lithography. The name “excimer” comes from the fact that these lasers create light by using an excited dimer, which is a molecule made up of two atoms.

ArF excimer lasers are one of the most popular types of lithography lasers due to their high performance and efficiency. They are also very stable, which makes them ideal for use in industrial settings.



Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global ArF Excimer Lasers market size is estimated to be worth US$ 16287 K USD in 2022 and is forecast to a readjusted size of US$ 26700 K USD by 2028 with a CAGR of 8.6% during the review period.







Fully considering the economic change by this health crisis, ArF Dry Light Sources accounting for 26.29% of the ArF Excimer Lasers global market in 2021, is projected to value US$ 7235 K USD by 2028, growing at a revised 9.3% CAGR in the post-COVID-19 period. While Semiconductor Lithography segment is altered to an 10% CAGR throughout this forecast period.



The global major manufacturers of ArF Excimer Lasers include Gigaphoton, Cymer (ASML), Beijing RSLaser, Coherent, Optosystems, MLase AG, LightMachinery, ATL Lasertechnik GmbH, LDI Innovation, and GAM Laser, Inc., etc. In terms of revenue, the global 5 largest players have a 80% market share of ArF Excimer Lasers in 2021.



ArF excimer lasers have obvious disadvantages: large size, complex structure, and the need to replace the working gas regularly. However, due to its high energy and high power output advantages in the ultraviolet band, it plays an irreplaceable role in many key fields, and is still being developed. new application directions.



At present, the terminal applications of ArF excimer lasers are mainly scientific research institutions and colleges, and the main applications of the enterprise end are fiber Bragg gratings, etc., and the medical field is also a major application direction of ArF excimer lasers. As far as the current market is concerned, due to conflicts between some countries, such as the trade friction between China and the United States, the Russian-Ukrainian war has affected the sales of companies in a certain country to a certain extent. In the future, reducing the cost of use and improving the maintainability will be the direction of excimer laser improvement.

Market challenges:



The ArF Excimer Lasers market faces a number of challenges, including:



1. High cost of ownership: ArF excimer lasers are expensive to purchase and operate, with a typical system costing over $1 million. This high cost limits their use to only the most well-funded research laboratories and industrial facilities.



2. Limited availability: There are only a handful of manufacturers producing ArF excimer lasers, and their output is limited. This shortage has caused prices to rise, making them even less affordable for many users.



3. Complexity: ArF excimer lasers are complex devices, requiring skilled operators to set up and maintain them. This can limit their use in many applications where simpler laser systems would be more appropriate.



4. Safety concerns: ArF excimer lasers emit UV radiation that can be harmful to the eyes and skin. They must be used with care and proper safety precautions must be taken when using them.

Market trends:

Some of the key market trends that may impact ArF Excimer Lasers include:



1. The increasing popularity of 3D printing. ArF Excimer Lasers are often used in 3D printing applications, and as this technology becomes more mainstream, the demand for these lasers is likely to increase.



2. The continued development of new and improved laser technologies. As laser technology advances, newer and more advanced lasers are being developed that can offer better performance and lower costs. This could result in a decrease in demand for ArF Excimer Lasers as customers switch to newer models.



3. The fluctuating price of raw materials. ArF Excimer Lasers contain rare earth minerals that can be expensive to purchase on the open market. If prices for these materials rise, it could result in an increase in the cost of ArF Excimer Lasers.
