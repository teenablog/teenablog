PTFE V-type composite packing, also known as PTFE Vee or PTFE Chevron Packing, is a specialized sealing material made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which is widely recognized for its exceptional properties in extreme environments. PTFE is a fluoropolymer known for its resistance to high temperatures, chemicals, and wear. As an axially acting elastic seal, PTFE V packing is typically used in applications where sealing effectiveness is paramount in harsh conditions, such as in oil-free, high-temperature, and highly corrosive environments.

The PTFE V-type composite packing is designed to withstand aggressive industrial processes, providing a reliable sealing solution for mechanical systems. This material is primarily used in industries where leakage prevention is critical, such as in the petrochemical sector, biomedical applications, food processing, and heavy machinery. The packing usually features a series of V-shaped layers, which enhance its sealing capabilities and provide superior leak resistance under high pressure.
