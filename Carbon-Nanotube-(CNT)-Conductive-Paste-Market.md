Carbon nanotube (CNT) conductive paste is a material made up of tiny tubes of carbon that are just a few nanometers in diameter. The paste is electrically conductive and can be used to create thin, flexible conductive coatings on surfaces.



CNT conductive paste can be applied using a variety of methods, including printing, painting, or spraying. Once it dries, the coating is extremely durable and can withstand repeated flexing and bending without losing its conductivity.



This makes CNT conductive paste an ideal material for use in wearable electronics, flexible printed circuit boards, and other applications where reliable electrical connections are needed in a small form factor.
