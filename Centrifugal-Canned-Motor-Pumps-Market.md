Centrifugal Canned Motor Pumps Market
The Centrifugal Canned Motor Pumps market has been experiencing continual growth for the past several years. The global market for Centrifugal Canned Motor Pump is expected to reach a significant valuation by the end of the year of assessment, to reflect a value of over US$ 2.10 billion by 2029. The global Centrifugal Canned Motor Pump market is projected to expand at a value CAGR of 3.30% throughout the period of assessment, 2023-2029. This expansion can be attributed to the increasing demand of recovery from the pandemic.



Centrifugal canned motor pumps are a special type of centrifugal pump that has an electric motor sealed within the pump casing. The purpose of these pumps is to eliminate the need for a conventional mechanical seal by integrating the motor and pump rotor into a single unit. This design ensures that the motor and rotor are completely enclosed and submerged in the fluid being pumped, allowing for operation without any seals and preventing leaks.

The construction of centrifugal canned motor pumps offers several advantages. By doing away with the mechanical seal, the risk of leakage and environmental contamination is significantly reduced. The hermetically sealed design also safeguards the motor from contaminants, enhancing its reliability and longevity. Furthermore, the absence of a shaft seal eliminates the need for seal maintenance and replacement, resulting in reduced downtime and lower maintenance costs.







The standard pumps segment is the largest segment of the centrifugal canned motor pumps market. This is due to the wide range of applications for standard pumps, such as water transfer, wastewater treatment, and HVAC. The standard pumps segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.0% from 2022 to 2030.



These pumps find widespread use in applications that require leak-free and dependable operation, particularly in industries such as chemicals, petrochemicals, oil refineries, pharmaceuticals, and nuclear power plants. They are capable of handling a wide range of fluids, including corrosive, hazardous, and high-temperature liquids.



Centrifugal canned motor pumps offer efficient and reliable pumping solutions while ensuring the safety and environmental integrity of the entire process.
