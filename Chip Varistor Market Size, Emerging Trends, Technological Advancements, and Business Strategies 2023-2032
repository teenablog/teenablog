Chip varistor are ideal, surface mountable components for transient overvoltage protection. They have ceramic multilayer structure which zinc oxide (ZnO) is the principal ingredient. Great protection of electrical and electronic equipments, such as absorption of abnormal voltage/ inductive lightning surge. These components are designed for circuit protection in automotive, industrial and consumer electronics.

A chip varistor is an essential electronic component utilized for safeguarding sensitive electronic circuits against sudden voltage surges or spikes. It operates as a voltage-dependent resistor (VDR) and displays a non-linear resistance characteristic, implying that its resistance varies with changes in voltage.

Typically composed of a ceramic material like zinc oxide, the chip varistor is designed to be compact and small, facilitating its seamless integration into electronic devices and circuit boards.

Once the voltage across a chip varistor exceeds a specific threshold, it initiates the conduction of current, effectively diverting excessive voltage away from the protected circuit. By absorbing and dissipating the surplus energy, chip varistors prevent potential damage to delicate components and uphold the overall stability and reliability of electronic systems.

The widespread use of chip varistors spans across various electronic devices and equipment, encompassing power supplies, telecommunication systems, computers, industrial machinery, and automotive electronics. These varistorsâ€™ ability to promptly respond to voltage fluctuations and provide robust protection establishes them as vital components for guarding sensitive electronics against sudden changes in voltage.

Key trends:
Miniaturization As communications and consumer products become more integrated, miniaturized, and multifunctional, chip varistors are required to be smaller in size
Low Voltage Transient voltage and surge current are fatal to integrated circuits and semiconductor devices, especially in recent years because of the gradual decline of the operating voltage of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices, it is necessary to develop chip varistors with low operating voltage (less than 5 volts).
Integrated Array In order to reduce the volume of chip varistors, several single varistors are integrated into a single electronic component, called a varistor bar.Compared with discrete devices, varistor bars can save space on the board and production and assembly costs.
Multiple Using LTCC technology, the varistor is combined with other components to form a multifunctional composite module, such as varistor and inductor, to form a module with both ESD protection and anti-EMI function.
