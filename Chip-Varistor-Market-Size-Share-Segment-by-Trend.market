The global Chip Varistor market is forecasted to keep the trend and expand to $ 994.25 million by 2028 from $ 617.25 million in 2022, growing at a CAGR of 8.27% from 2022 to 2028. And it is expected to reach 137707.67 million Pcs in 2028, in terms of volume.







Chip Varistor is a key component in the safety and reliability of semiconductor and electronic devices.



There are several reasons why chip varistors are important. First, they protect semiconductor chips from overheating. Overheating can damage the microchips and cause them to fail. Chip varistors help to prevent this by cooling the chip.



Second, chip varistors protect electronic devices from power surges. These surges can cause damage to the device, especially if they are powerful enough to overheat the chip. Chip varitors help to protect electronic devices from these surges by absorbing the energy before it can do any damage.



Finally, chip varistors are used in safety systems and medical equipment. They help to prevent malfunctions and errors in these systems.
