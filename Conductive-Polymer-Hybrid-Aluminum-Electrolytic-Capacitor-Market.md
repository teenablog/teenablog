An aluminum electrolytic capacitor, usually simply called an electrolytic capacitor (e-cap), is a capacitor whose anode (+) consists of pure aluminum foil with an etched surface, covered with a uniformly very thin barrier layer of insulating aluminum oxide, which operates as a dielectric. The electrolyte, which covers the rough surface of the oxide layer, operates as the second electrode, the cathode (-). E-caps have the largest capacitance values per unit volume compared to the two other main conventional capacitor families, ceramic and plastic film capacitors, but articulately smaller capacitance than similar sized supercapacitors.

A Conductive Polymer Hybrid Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitor serves as an electronic component utilized for storing energy and filtering electrical signals in various electronic devices and applications. It represents a specialized version of the standard aluminum electrolytic capacitor, as it incorporates a conductive polymer material into its design.

The capacitor is composed of two primary electrodes, typically made of aluminum, with a dielectric material separating them. In the case of the hybrid capacitor, the dielectric material is infused with a conductive polymer. This infusion of conductive polymer enhances the capacitor’s performance by providing several advantages over the traditional electrolytes found in standard aluminum electrolytic capacitors.
