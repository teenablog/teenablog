Copper Clad Laminate (CCL) is a material extensively used in the manufacturing of printed circuit boards (PCBs). It comprises a layer of copper foil that is laminated onto a substrate, typically composed of fiberglass reinforced with epoxy resin. The copper foil establishes conductive pathways for electrical signals, while the substrate offers mechanical support and insulation.
