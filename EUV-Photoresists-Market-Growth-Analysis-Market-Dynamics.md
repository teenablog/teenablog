Key Trends:



Sensitivity and resolution improvements: As EUV technology continues advancing to enable smaller node sizes, photoresists need to be more sensitive to achieve higher resolutions and finer line widths. Resist manufacturers are working on new resist formulations with improved sensitivity.
Line edge roughness (LER) and line width roughness (LWR) reductions: To enable tighter patterning specifications, resists are being optimized to reduce LER and LWR which can cause device defects. Better controlling these metrics helps improve chip yield.
Low-defect resists: As EUV lithography exposes resists to high energy photons, defects can be introduced which cause chip failures. Developing resists that minimize defect formation is important for reliability.
Resist dryness: As EUV systems require a dry lithography process run in vacuum, resists need properties like low outgassing to maintain vacuum levels. Dry resists avoid issues like pattern collapse during development.
Multipatterning compatibility: Many chip designs now require multipatterning lithography techniques like self-aligned double patterning (SADP). Resists must be compatible with the additional processing steps involved in these methods.
Environmental/safety improvements: Manufacturers aim to reduce the environmental and health impacts of photoresist materials by minimizing the use of volatile organic compounds and other hazardous chemicals.
Increased EUV source power support: As EUV source wattages rise to support higher throughput production, resists need to withstand higher photon doses without degrading resolution or line edge quality.
