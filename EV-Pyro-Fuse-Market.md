The functioning principle of Pyro-Fuses entails the utilization of a small quantity of gunpowder to generate an explosion. This explosion leads to the rupture of a miniature metal tube, thereby interrupting the flow of electricity. This entire process occurs within an incredibly short span of time, effectively preventing any damage to the EV's electrical system.



Typically, Pyro-Fuses are situated within the battery pack of the electric vehicle. Furthermore, they may also find application in other components with high voltage requirements, such as the motor controller.



The major global manufacturers of EV Pyro-Fuse include: Autoliv, Daicel, Pacific Engineering Corporation (PEC), Littelfuse, Mersen, Eaton, Miba AG, MTA Group, and Xi'an Sinofuse Electric, etc. In 2022, the world's top three vendors accounted for approximately 65.13% of the revenue.
