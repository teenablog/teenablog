An electric fuse is a safety device that is designed to protect an electrical circuit from excessive current. It is essentially a thin wire or filament that is enclosed in a protective casing and placed in series with the electrical circuit. When the current flowing through the circuit exceeds the rated value of the fuse, the wire inside the fuse melts and breaks the circuit, thereby preventing any further damage or hazards. Electric fuses are widely used in various applications, including residential and commercial electrical systems, automotive and industrial machinery, and electronic devices.
