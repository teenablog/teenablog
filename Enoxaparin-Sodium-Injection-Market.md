Enoxaparin is commonly used in cardiac patients. As with all low molecular weight heparins, (LMWHs) the drug is easy to administer subcutaneously as compared with intravenous infusion of unfractionated heparin. Unlike other LMWHs, enoxaparin has been shown to be superior to intravenous unfractionated heparin in patients with non-ST elevation and ST elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and a comparable agent in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with decreased bleeding. However, elective PCI in patients without ACS is currently not in the enoxaparin label. It primarily inhibits factors Xa and IIa with a greater effect on factor Xa. Enoxaparin is renally cleared and a dose adjustment by 50% reduction is recommended for patients with creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min. In patients aged 75 years or older undergoing fibrinolysis, it is recommended that the intravenous bolus of 30 mg be omitted and that only 75% of the usually recommended dose of 1 mg/kg subcutaneously twice-daily be administered.



Enoxaparin sodium, sold under the brand name Lovenox among others, is an anticoagulant medication (blood thinner). It is used to treat and prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) including during pregnancy and following certain types of surgery. It is also used in those with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and heart attacks. It is given by injection just under the skin or into a vein. It is also used during hemodialysis.



The commonly used drugs such as hydroxychloroquine have witnessed a dramatic surge in demand for the management of COVID-19. Such high demand for these drugs has presented huge opportunities for manufacturers of COVID-19 management drugs, as many developed countries are facing shortage of these drugs. Thus, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are expected to witness a significant growth in the future, owing to the demand for vaccine and treatment drugs for COVID-19. This, in turn, is expected to have a significant impact on the global enoxaparin sodium market.
