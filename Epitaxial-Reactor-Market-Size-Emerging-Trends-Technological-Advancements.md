Epitaxial has been a primary application of Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). In semiconductor manufacturing, epitaxial processes are used to produce the perfect crystal layers needed to manufacture semiconductor devices, to deposit crystal films with the designed electrical properties or to modify the mechanical properties of the substrate to enhance its electrical conductivity.

 

The global Epitaxial Reactor market was valued at US$ 1322.9 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 2244.8 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 7.8% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Epitaxial reactor is a specialized device used in semiconductor manufacturing to deposit thin layers of crystalline material onto a semiconductor substrate. The process is known as epitaxy, which involves growing a crystal layer with a specific crystal orientation and structure that matches the underlying substrate. The epitaxial reactor provides controlled conditions for the deposition process, such as temperature, gas composition, and pressure, to achieve precise layer thickness and crystal quality.

The semiconductor industry is experiencing remarkable growth on a global scale. The escalating demand for electronic devices, such as smartphones, laptops, and tablets, is a key driver behind this growth. As a result, the epitaxial reactor market is poised to benefit significantly from the expansion of the semiconductor industry.

In addition, the LED industry is undergoing rapid growth due to the rising need for energy-efficient and durable lighting solutions. This surge in demand within the LED industry is expected to have a positive impact on the epitaxial reactor market.

Likewise, the solar cell industry is also witnessing substantial growth, primarily fueled by the increasing demand for renewable energy sources. As the solar cell industry expands, the epitaxial reactor market is anticipated to reap the benefits of this growth.

The epitaxially grown new single crystal layer can be different from the substrate in terms of conductivity type, resistivity, etc., and can also grow multi-layer single crystals with different thicknesses and different requirements, thereby greatly improving the flexibility of device design and device performance. The epitaxial process is also widely used in PN junction isolation technology in integrated circuits and in improving material quality in large-scale integrated circuits.

The core of an epitaxial (epi) reactor is the reaction chamber, typically made of quartz. Inside the chamber a holder for the silicon substrates, typically made of graphite coated with silicon carbide, is heated up to 900-1250°C while gases flow inside. These gases contain a volatile silicon compound and some dopant compounds carried by a chemical reducing or inert main gas flow.
