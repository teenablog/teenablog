Exothermic welding, also known as exothermic bonding, is a process that uses heat to join two conductors together. The process is similar to soldering, but the heat required is much higher. Exothermic welding is often used to connect electrical cables or wires together, as well as to connect metal pipes.



The process begins by heating the end of one conductor with an electric arc. This heats the metal until it melts and forms a pool of molten metal. The other conductor is then placed in the pool, and the two pieces are allowed to cool and solidify. The resulting bond is very strong and can withstand high temperatures and pressures.
