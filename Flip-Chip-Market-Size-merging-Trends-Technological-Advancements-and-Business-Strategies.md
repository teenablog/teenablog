Product Details
Flip Chip is a semiconductor packaging technology that involves directly mounting a microchip or a die onto a substrate or a printed circuit board (PCB) without the use of wires or leads.

In this process, the face of the chip is flipped over so that its active side faces down, and the connections are made through small bumps, or solder balls, that are placed on the chip’s contact pads. The bumps are then aligned and bonded to matching pads on the substrate or PCB, forming a direct electrical connection between the chip and the board.

Flip Chip technology offers advantages over traditional wire-bonding packaging methods, including higher connection density, faster data transfer, and improved thermal performance. It is widely used in a variety of electronic devices, such as microprocessors, memory chips, and sensors.

The global Flip Chip market was valued at US$ 12440 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 19100 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 6.3% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.
