Recent Development:



The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported that demand for air cargo declined by 7.7% in March 2023, compared to the previous year. This trend began in March 2022 and has continued for 13 months.
However, the IATA also reported that capacity increased by 11.2% in July 2022, compared to the previous year. This increase was due to the growth in belly capacity, which increased by 29.3% year-on-year.
Industry experts predict that the air cargo sector will have increased capacity in 2023, due to the recovery of the belly space of passenger flights. This could also lead to a drop in freight rates.
FedEx Express is the largest cargo airline in the world.
