key trends shaping the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) catalyst market:



Development of ultra stable Y-zeolite based FCC catalysts to maximize liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propylene yields from lower quality feedstocks. This also enhances gasoline octane ratings.

Rising focus on metals trapping and metals passivation technologies to limit detrimental effects of metal impurities like nickel and vanadium on product yields.

Growing demand for residue upgrading FCC catalysts that can unlock heavier crudes by higher bottoms cracking and produce feedstocks for petrochemicals.

Use of bio-based feedstock like palm and soybean oil as sustainable sources for manufacturing glues and binders used in FCC catalysts matrix and substrates.

Advances in CAT-REG (regenerator catalyst) additives to limit excessive hydrocarbon combustion and NOx formation in the regenerator, ensuring optimal performance.

Introduction of ASPIRE FCC technologies by leading players like Grace that use automated computational models to predict FCC catalyst deactivation rates and optimize run-lengths.
