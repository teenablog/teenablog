LTCC Ceramic Substrates is a type of multilayer ceramic substrate that made by lower temperature (usually from 850 to 900) firing process than general ceramic firing process by adding glass to alumina. It makes it possible to use low resistive conductor as conductor patterns in. The LTCC components include LC filters, directional coupler, power splitter and antenna etc. The LTCC ceramic substrates include Bluetooth substrates and mobile front-end module substrates, and the LTCC modules include phone antenna modules, Bluetooth modules and power amplifier modules etc.

LTCC stands for Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic. It is a technology used in the manufacturing of electronic components, particularly in microelectronics and RF (Radio Frequency) applications. LTCC involves the co-firing of ceramic materials at relatively low temperatures (usually below 1000Â°C) to create a multi-layered structure with embedded conductive traces and vias. LTCC technology offers several advantages such as high reliability, excellent electrical performance, good thermal stability, and miniaturization capabilities. It is commonly used in the production of antennas, filters, sensors, and other high-frequency applications.
