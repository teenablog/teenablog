The main drivers of growth for the Sodium Cyanide market are the increasing demand from the mining industry and the growing use of Sodium Cyanide in chemical manufacturing.



Fully considering the economic change by this health crisis, solid sodium cyanide accounting for 74.28% of the sodium cyanide global market in 2021, is projected to value US$ 2,474.1 million by 2028, growing at a revised 5.59% CAGR from 2022 to 2028. While mining industry segment consumption volume is altered to a 2.70 % CAGR throughout this forecast period.

Market Segmentation:



The global sodium cyanide market is segmented based on type, application, and geography.



The market for sodium cyanide is divided into two types: solid and liquid. Solid sodium cyanide is the most common type used in mining applications. It is a white, powdery substance that is highly toxic. Liquid sodium cyanide is less common, but it can be used in certain industrial applications.



The global sodium cyanide market is also segmented by application. The major applications of sodium cyanide are in mining and chemical manufacturing. In mining, it is used to extract gold and other precious metals from ore. In chemical manufacturing, it is used to make organic and inorganic chemicals.



Geographically, China sodium cyanide market size was US$ 768.5 million in 2021, while North America was US$ 431.3 million. The proportion of the China was 35.95% in 2021, while North America's percentage was 20.18%, and it is predicted that China market share will reach 38.33% in 2028, trailing a CAGR of 5.64 % through the analysis period. As for the Asia, the notable markets are Australia and South Korea, CAGR is 5.76% and 2.67% respectively for the next 6-year period.Â 





Market Dynamics



Among end user, the mining industry segment is witnessing significant market share in the market. Increasing mining activities worldwide has led to high consumption of sodium cyanide for extraction of gold and other precious metals. For instance, according to Indian Minerals Yearbook 2021, the index of mineral production for all minerals in India (excluding atomic minerals stood at 132.2 points in 2016-17 registering an increase of 2.2% over that 2015-2016.



Asia Pacific accounted for a significant market share in 2021, owing to substantial demand for sodium cynide from gold and silver mining industry in the region. Accroding to the U.S. Geological Survey 2013, production of mined gold in Asia Pacific accounted for around 31% of the worldwide production in 2013. Moroever, China was the leading producer of mined gold in the region, followed by Australia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea.
