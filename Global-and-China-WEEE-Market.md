In China the WEEE (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment) Recycling market size is expected to grow from US$ 1,541.98 million in 2021 to US$ 2,739.62 million by 2028, at a CAGR of 8.72% during the forecast period.



More than 50 million tons of e-waste are generated globally every year. Some of it ends up in landfills, where toxic chemicals can leach out over time. E-waste can also flow to developing countries, where informal e-waste disposal can cause serious health and pollution problems.



In 2019, global WEEE was 53.6 million tons, with only 9.3 million tons of recorded collection and recycling, a recovery rate of 17.4%, compared with 57.4 million tons of global WEEE in 2021, with only 9.3 million tons of recorded collection and recycling 11.17 million tons, the recycling rate is 20.13%, and 7.5 kg of waste electronic products are produced per capita.



The United States has no national legislation on e-waste management, but 25 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of legislation. State laws vary in scope and impact, as well as in whether to prohibit consumers from disposing of electronic products in landfills. Collectively, these laws cover 75-80% of the U.S. population. However, many areas of the country, including the states covered by law, do not have convenient collection methods due to varying scope. Except for California and Utah, all states that have implemented laws use Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). Canada does not have national legislation to effectively manage e-waste because federal agencies do not have this authority. However, 12 provinces and territories have developed regulations using industry management plans, with the exception of Nunavut, Canada's least populous territory. On average, the product range is much wider than in the United States; in many Canadian provinces, compliance with the EPR can be achieved by joining an approved e-waste compliance program. Regulation in Latin America has moved slowly, with only a few countries managing to establish e-waste laws.



Although Latin America has made considerable progress in implementing specific e-waste regulations over the past 5-10 years, this progress has been limited to a few countries, while for others the road ahead remains very long. With the exception of Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia and Peru, which are likely to be the leading players in the region's environmentally sound e-waste management and are committed to improving the systems already in place in 2020, only Brazil and Chile are building the foundations from which to begin implementing formal E-waste regulatory framework. Brazil recently published the "Sectoral Agreement for the Implementation of the WEEE Reverse Logistics System from a Household Perspective" for public comment. The agreement is expected to be formally signed in 2020. Following the enactment of the Waste Management, Extended Producer Responsibility and Promotion of Recycling Framework Law in 2016, Chile is currently developing specific e-waste regulations, which will include collection and recycling targets and develop guidance for the implementation of a formal collection system policy.



Seven years after implementing Decree No. 1512 on waste from computers, printers and peripherals, Colombia is developing a new ordinance to expand e-waste classification to all e-waste categories and for integrated e-waste management The system is adjusted, taking into account lessons learned and guidelines established in accordance with WEEE Law No. 1672 and the WEEE National Management Policy. Looking back on the five years since the implementation of the first e-waste management system, Peru has been evaluating this experience very carefully so that it can fill the gaps and align with the country's general waste management strategy. The revised regulations are expected to be published soon and will expand the scope of e-waste categories with mandatory collection of small and large household appliances, especially cooling equipment.



Current statistics show that China is the largest e-waste producer in the world, generating 1,010 tons of e-waste in 2019. China plays a key role in the global EEE industry for two main reasons: China is the most populous country in the world, so domestic demand for EEE is very high, and it has a strong EEE manufacturing industry. In addition, China plays an important role in the refurbishment, reuse and recycling of e-waste. Driven by e-waste regulation and facility expansion, the formal e-waste recycling industry has made great strides in processing capacity and quality; more than 70 million e-waste units are dismantled each year (Ministry of Ecology and Environment, 2019 year). According to the Chinese government, the actual collection and recycling rate is 40%, but it is important to note that this figure is only for 5 EEE products, not the 54 EEE products listed in the International Classification of Electronic Waste (Annex 1). (United Nations University - Keys).



If all 54 products are taken into account, the collection and recycling rate drops to 15%. The informal sector has been in sharp decline due to tighter controls imposed by China's new environmental law. Illegal imports of e-waste are disappearing more rapidly due to the policy of banning the import of solid waste. However, the funding gap is growing. Taxation and subsidies present unique challenges to e-waste funding policies (Zeng et al., 2017). The Chinese government has set a target that, by 2025, 20% of the raw materials for new electronic products will be sourced from recycled materials and 50% of electronic waste will be recycled (World Economic Forum 2018). In 2018, the collection and recycling rate of e-waste in Taiwan Province of China reached 64% of products covered by legislation (37); this significant achievement is based on a 4-in-1 recycling system that focuses on applying the EPR concept to recycling systems. Under the supervision of the Recycling Fund Management Board (RFMB), the mechanism has been greatly improved. There are about 20 e-waste recycling facilities in Taiwan Province of China, and their production capacity is higher than the current domestic e-waste generation, so the e-waste recycling business in Taiwan Province of China is facing challenges.



And few countries in Africa, such as South Africa, Morocco, Egypt, Namibia and Rwanda, have some e-waste recycling facilities, but these facilities coexist with large informal industries. As a result, some of these recycling companies have been working hard to advance and increase their processing volumes, mobilizing new pilots and efforts through new initiatives. On the other hand, sizable countries such as Nigeria, Kenya and Ghana still rely heavily on informal recycling. A study conducted in Nigeria showed that in 2015 and 2016, around 60,000-71,000 tonnes of used EEE were imported into Nigeria through the two main ports of Lagos each year. The survey found that most of the imported waste electronic waste comes from developed countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the United States. In addition, a basic functional test showed that, on average, at least 19% of the devices did not work properly.
