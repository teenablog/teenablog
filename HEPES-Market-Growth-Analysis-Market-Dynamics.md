HEPES Powder

The HEPES powder segment dominated the global HEPES market in 2023, accounting for a share of around 55%. HEPES powder is widely used as a buffering agent in cell culture media and other biological research applications. It is preferred by many end users due to its stability and ability to maintain pH at optimal levels. The powder form also offers advantages in terms of storage and transportation. The segment is expected to witness steady growth during the forecast period.

HEPES Solution

The HEPES solution segment accounted for a revenue share of approximately 45% in the global market in 2023. HEPES solution finds extensive usage as a buffer in cell culture media and reagents for in vitro diagnostics. Many life science research organizations prefer the convenience of using ready-to-use HEPES solutions. However, the solution form has lesser shelf life compared to powder. Still, the ease of handling and preparation drives the popularity of HEPES solutions among end users. The segment is projected to showcase moderate growth over the next few years.

Cell Culture

The cell culture application was the major revenue generating segment in 2023, holding a share of around 65% of the global HEPES market. HEPES is widely used as a buffering agent in cell culture media to maintain optimal pH levels for cell growth. It helps mimic physiological conditions outside the body and support various cell-based assays. Increased R&D on cell-based therapies and vaccines is fueling the demand for HEPES in cell culture. The segment is expected to continue its dominance during the forecast period.



IVD Reagents



The IVD reagents segment accounted for a revenue share of approximately 25% in 2023. HEPES finds application as a buffer in reagents used for in vitro diagnostics procedures. It helps maintain stable pH conditions required for various biochemical and immunological tests. Increasing volume of diagnostic tests performed globally is driving the consumption of HEPES in IVD reagents. However, alternatives being introduced may hamper the growth of this segment.
