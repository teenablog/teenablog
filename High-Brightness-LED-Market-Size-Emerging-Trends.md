BenQ Launches High Brightness 4 LED Projector

BenQ has launched the LH730 high brightness 4 LED projector. This new projector is claimed to be brighter and more efficient than traditional 3 LED projectors, thanks to its new 4 LED light source.

High power LEDs typically have a maximum driving current of 350 – 1000 mA, and commercially available 1 W packages can produce in excess of 100 lumens/watt. This means that the LH730’s 4 LED light source is capable of producing a significant amount of light.

In addition to its high brightness, the LH730 also features a high contrast ratio and support for 4K HDR content. This ensures that images will be clear, sharp, and realistic. The projector also has a low throw ratio, which means that it can be placed close to the screen, making it ideal for small rooms.

The LH730 is a versatile projector that can be used for a variety of applications, including home theater, business, and education. It is a good choice for users who are looking for a high brightness projector with a lot of features.
