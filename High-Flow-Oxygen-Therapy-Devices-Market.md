High Flow Oxygen Therapy (HFOT) is a type of respiratory therapy that delivers oxygen at a higher than normal flow rate. The goal of HFOT is to improve the amount of oxygen that reaches the lungs and bloodstream.



HFOT is often used for people who have difficulty breathing, such as those with COPD, cystic fibrosis, or other lung conditions. It can also be used for people who have had surgery or who are recovering from an injury.



HFOT can be provided through a variety of devices, including nasal cannulas, face masks, and ventilators. The type of device used will depend on the individualâ€™s needs.



HFOT can be beneficial for people who are struggling to breathe. It can help to improve oxygenation and reduce the work of breathing. HFOT can also be used to prevent respiratory problems from getting worse.
