In a hydrogen gas injection system, hydrogen gas is added to the air intake of the engine, and when it mixes with the diesel fuel, it produces a more complete combustion process. The result is a more efficient use of the fuel and lower emissions, as the hydrogen gas reacts with the diesel fuel to create water vapor instead of harmful pollutants like nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM).
