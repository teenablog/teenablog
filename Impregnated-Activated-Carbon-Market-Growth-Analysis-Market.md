Impregnated activated carbon is produced by treating activated carbon with a variety of impregnants, such as metals, metal oxides, or other chemicals, to improve its performance in specific applications.

The impregnants can increase the carbon's capacity for adsorbing certain contaminants, such as sulfur compounds, chlorine, or mercury.



Impregnated activated carbon can also be used to catalyze chemical reactions, such as the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx).
