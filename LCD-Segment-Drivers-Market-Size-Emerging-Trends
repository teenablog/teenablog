LCD Segment Drivers support any static or multiplexed LCD containing up to a certain number of segments or icons. LCD Segment Drivers can be used in several markets such as consumer, metering, white goods, healthcare, battery operated products and also automotive applications.

 

An LCD segment driver is a chip or circuit that is used to control the segments of a liquid crystal display (LCD). LCDs are made up of a grid of pixels, each of which can be turned on or off to create an image. The segments are the individual lines or bars that make up each pixel. The LCD segment driver controls the voltage applied to each segment, which determines whether it is turned on or off.
