LNG composite hose is a type of hose used for transferring liquefied natural gas (LNG) at cryogenic temperatures.



LNG composite hoses are made of multiple layers of materials, including inner and outer layers of polymer, a reinforcing layer of braided or spiral-wound fiber, and a metal wire or strip to provide conductivity.
The hose is designed to withstand the extreme temperatures and pressures associated with LNG transfer, with operating temperatures as low as -196°C and pressures up to 25 bar.
LNG composite hoses are lightweight, flexible, and easy to handle, making them ideal for use in ship-to-ship and ship-to-shore LNG transfer operations.
The hoses are also resistant to weathering, UV radiation, and chemicals, ensuring long-lasting performance in harsh marine environments.
LNG composite hoses are tested and certified to meet international standards, such as EN 13766 and ASTM D380, to ensure safe and reliable operation.
