The global Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) market witnessed a valuation of US$ 740 million in 2023.



Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) is a medical isotope used in targeted radionuclide therapy for treating certain types of cancer, such as neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. It's an innovative therapy that delivers targeted radiation directly to cancer cells, minimizing damage to healthy tissues. Lu-177 can be attached to targeting molecules, which seek out and bind to specific cancer cells, enabling precise treatment. This precision makes it an effective option for cancer patients whose disease is advanced or has spread. It's an exciting advancement in the field of cancer treatment, offering new hope for those who may have few other treatment options.
