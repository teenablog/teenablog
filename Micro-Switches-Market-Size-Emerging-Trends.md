Micro switch, also trademarked and frequently known as miniature snap-action switch, is an electric switch that is actuated by very little physical force, through the use of a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an “over-center” mechanism.

Switching happens reliably at specific and repeatable positions of the actuator, which is not necessarily true of other mechanisms. They are very common due to their low cost and durability, greater than 1 million cycles and up to 24 million cycles for heavy duty models. This durability is a natural consequence of the design.

Micro switches, also known as snap-action switches or miniature snap-action switches, represent a specific type of electrical switch designed to function with minimal physical force. These switches are typically compact and incorporate a spring-loaded lever or actuator mechanism that enables them to quickly snap open or closed when the actuator is pressed or released.

The distinguishing features of micro switches include their precise and reliable operation, rapid response time, and a distinctive “click” sound upon activation. Their versatility makes them a popular choice for a wide range of electronic and mechanical devices, household appliances, and industrial applications where a sensitive and space-efficient switching mechanism is essential.



Micro switches find applications in various products and systems, including:

Household appliances: They play a crucial role in microwave ovens, refrigerators, washing machines, and other household appliances to detect door openings or control specific functions.
HVAC systems: Micro switches are employed in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems to control fans and air dampers effectively.
Automotive industry: Within vehicles, micro switches are used in car door latches, brake lights, and various control functions.
Electronics and computers: They find use in computer keyboards, computer mice, and other input devices to enable responsive user interactions.
Industrial equipment: Micro switches are integrated into safety interlocks, limit switches, and control panels within industrial machinery to ensure reliable and secure operations.
