The global Microchannel Cooler market was valued at US$ 114.6 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 225.4 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 10.1% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Micro-channel cooling is commonly achieved with the aid of a heat sink consisting of a high conductivity substrate that contains a large number of parallel, small diameter channels. These heat sinks are very compact and lightweight, and by allowing the coolant to undergo phase change (boiling) along the channels, they provide heat transfer coefficients far greater than those possible with single-phase liquid counterparts.

The microchannel cooler market refers to the industry involved in the production, distribution, and sale of microchannel coolers. Microchannel coolers are heat exchangers designed to dissipate heat from electronic components, such as microprocessors and power electronics. They are commonly used in applications where thermal management is crucial, such as data centers, automotive electronics, aerospace systems, and high-power laser diodes.

Microchannel coolers offer several advantages over traditional cooling methods, including compact size, high heat transfer efficiency, and uniform temperature distribution. They consist of a network of small channels through which a cooling fluid, usually liquid or gas, flows to remove heat generated by the electronic device. The fluid absorbs the heat and carries it away, preventing the device from overheating and ensuring optimal performance and reliability.
