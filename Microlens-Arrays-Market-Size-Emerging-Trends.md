Micro-Lens array is an array composed of lenses with micron aperture and relief depth. It not only has the basic functions of traditional lens such as focusing and imaging, but also has the characteristics of small unit size and high integration, which makes it able to complete the functions that traditional optical elements canâ€™t accomplish, and can form many new optical systems.

Microlens arrays, often abbreviated as MLAs, are arrays of miniature lenses typically fabricated on a flat surface, such as a glass or silicon wafer. These arrays consist of numerous tiny lens elements, each focusing light independently. Microlens arrays find applications in various fields and technologies, including optics, imaging, electronics, and photonics.
