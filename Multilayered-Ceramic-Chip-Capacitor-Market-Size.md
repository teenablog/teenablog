May 2023: Murata Introduces Compact High-Capacitance MLCC

In May 2023, Murata Manufacturing Co. Ltd (Murata) unveiled its latest innovation in multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) to cater to the increasing demand for components that offer both elevated capacitance levels and compact form factors while maintaining enhanced temperature performance. This newly introduced MLCC boasts an impressive capacitance value of 10µF with a ±20% tolerance. It’s a part of the GRM series and is packaged in the 0201-inch/0603M size. Remarkably, these MLCCs hold the distinction of being the smallest products on the market capable of delivering such high capacitance levels. This represents a remarkable 65% reduction in size compared to the more conventional 0402-inch/1005M products.

Apr 2023: Samsung Electro-Mechanics Launches High-Capacity MLCC for Automotive Applications

In April 2023, Samsung Electro-Mechanics introduced a noteworthy addition to the MLCC landscape—a 1210-inch MLCC with an impressive capacitance of 220 μF. This specific MLCC is designed for automotive applications and is particularly well-suited for deployment in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD) technologies in automobiles. The growing electrification of vehicles and their increasing capabilities have led to a burgeoning variety of MLCCs being used within a single car, showcasing the vital role of these components in the automotive industry.

Enhanced Performance with Lower ESL: Companies are developing MLCCs with reduced Equivalent Series Resistance (ESL) compared to conventional 2-terminal capacitors. This reduction in impedance in high-frequency bands is gaining prominence, especially in high-end electronics such as smartphones. These compact components are crucial for accommodating high-speed processors in smaller and denser electronic devices.

5G Network Expansion: The rapid expansion of 5G networks is a pivotal driver of the MLCC market. According to GSMA, 5G networks are projected to reach one-third of the global population by 2025, with over 1 billion 5G connections anticipated by the end of 2022. This growth fuels the demand for 5G-enabled devices, including smartphones.

Smaller and Compact Devices: As 5G-capable smartphones become more widespread and wearable devices gain multifunctional capabilities, the demand for smaller and higher-density electronic circuitry is surging. This trend aligns with the need for compact components like MLCCs to support these advanced devices.

Internet of Things (IoT) Expansion: The proliferation of IoT devices is another significant growth catalyst. Short-range IoT devices are projected to grow from around 10.29 billion in 2022 to approximately 25.15 billion by 2027, according to Ericsson. Additionally, wide-area IoT devices are expected to increase from 2.8 billion in 2022 to 5.4 billion by 2027. MLCCs are integral to IoT products, especially those designed to be ultra-compact and wearable.

Emerging Markets and Wearables: The increasing adoption of smartphones in emerging markets, along with the growing market for IoT and wearable devices, offsets potential challenges. Volumetric efficiency issues associated with wearables and compact IoT devices make MLCCs, with their small case sizes, a preferred choice for these applications.
