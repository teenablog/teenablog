Key Manufacturers:



Molecular Products: As a major player in the Ortho-Para Hydrogen Conversion Catalyst market, Molecular Products, Inc. is a primary provider of these catalysts, addressing the growing demand in the industry.
In 2022, the 101th Institute of the Sixth Academy of Aerospace Science and Technology in China successfully developed Ortho-Para Hydrogen Conversion Catalyst, showcasing excellent comprehensive performance. They completed the construction of the first ton-level production line in China, marking a significant development in the global catalyst market.


Ortho-Para hydrogen conversion catalyst is a type of catalyst used in the hydrogen gas industry to convert ortho-hydrogen (o-H2) to para-hydrogen (p-H2).



Ortho-hydrogen and para-hydrogen are two forms of hydrogen gas that differ in their nuclear spin states.
At room temperature, hydrogen gas is typically a mixture of 75% ortho-hydrogen and 25% para-hydrogen.
Ortho-hydrogen is unstable and will spontaneously convert to para-hydrogen over time, releasing heat in the process.
Ortho-para hydrogen conversion catalysts accelerate this conversion process, allowing hydrogen gas to be stored and transported more safely and efficiently.
The most common types of ortho-para hydrogen conversion catalysts are based on iron oxide (Fe2O3, IONEX®) and chromium oxide doped silica (CrO·SiO2, OXISORB®).
