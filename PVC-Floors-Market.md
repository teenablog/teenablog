PVC floors offer resistance to water, stains, and wear, making them ideal for a variety of applications, such as offices, hospitals, schools, retail stores, and even homes. These floors are typically chosen for their versatility in design and their cost-effectiveness compared to other flooring materials.

Additionally, the rise of DIY (Do-It-Yourself) installations has played a pivotal role in the market's expansion, especially in the residential segment.

Growth Projections:

The market is expected to continue expanding in the coming years, reaching USD 20,332.17 million by 2032. Factors such as the increasing urbanization, the rise of home improvement trends, and the growing demand for low-maintenance flooring solutions are anticipated to drive market growth.
