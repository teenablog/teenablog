A peak flow meter is a portable, easy-to-use device that measures how well your lungs are able to expel air. By blowing hard through a mouthpiece on one end, the peak flow meter can measure the force of air in liters per minute and give you a reading on a built-in numbered scale. If you have asthma, your doctor may recommend that you use a peak flow meter to help track your asthma control.

A Peak Flowmeter is a medical device used to measure the peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), which is the maximum airflow a person can achieve when exhaling forcefully. PEFR is an important indicator of lung function and is commonly used in the management of respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
