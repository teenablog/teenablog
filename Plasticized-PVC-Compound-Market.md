Non-plasticized PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) compound is a modified version of traditional PVC resin that incorporates a range of additives, stabilizers, fillers, and plasticizers to enhance its properties and performance. Unlike plasticized PVC, which contains plasticizers to make it more flexible, non-plasticized PVC compound retains the rigidity and durability of pure PVC. This material is widely used in applications where flexibility is not a key requirement but strength, stability, and durability are essential. Typical applications for non-plasticized PVC include piping, profiles, tubes, and certain medical devices, as it offers high mechanical strength, chemical resistance, and heat resistance.

In non-plasticized PVC compounds, additives are typically mixed in a controlled process to achieve the required performance characteristics, such as improved weatherability, UV resistance, flame retardance, or impact strength. The resulting material can be produced in various grades depending on the specific needs of the industry.
