Market Size

Polypropylene Cables (PP Cables) are a type of electrical cables that utilize polypropylene as their primary insulating material. Polypropylene, a thermoplastic polymer, offers superior dielectric properties, making these cables highly resistant to electrical stress, temperature variations, and moisture. These characteristics make PP Cables an ideal choice for various applications, including power transmission, telecommunications, automotive wiring, and industrial machinery.

Compared to traditional polyethylene and PVC-insulated cables, PP Cables provide better energy efficiency, lower weight, and improved recyclability. Their adoption is increasing due to the global push for sustainable and high-performance electrical infrastructure.
