The global Post CMP Cleaning market was valued at US$ 193.6 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 319.8 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 7.4% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

Post CMP cleaning refers to the process of removing particles, residues, and contaminants from the surface of a substrate after undergoing chemical mechanical planarization (CMP). CMP is a critical step in the manufacturing of semiconductors, where it is used to create a flat and smooth surface on the substrate.

While CMP is essential for achieving the desired substrate surface, it often leaves behind residues that can negatively impact the performance and reliability of the semiconductor. Post CMP cleaning is therefore employed to effectively eliminate these residues and ensure the quality of the semiconductor.

The cleaning process typically involves using specialized cleaning solutions or chemicals, such as acidic or alkaline cleaners, to remove the residues and particles. Various techniques may be utilized, including ultrasonic cleaning, plasma cleaning, or electrochemical cleaning, depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the semiconductor.

Post CMP cleaning plays a crucial role in enhancing the yield and functionality of semiconductors, as it ensures the cleanliness and integrity of the substrate surface. By removing any contaminants left behind by the CMP process, post CMP cleaning contributes to the overall quality and performance of the final semiconductor product.
