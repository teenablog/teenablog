Rhenium is an extremely rare, high-performance transition metal with unique properties that make it indispensable in specialized industries. With an atomic number of 75, it has one of the highest melting points (3,186°C) and exceptional heat resistance. Due to its rarity, rhenium is primarily obtained as a byproduct of molybdenum and copper mining. It is widely used in aerospace for high-temperature turbine blades, in catalysts for refining high-octane gasoline, and in electronics due to its resistance to wear and corrosion.
