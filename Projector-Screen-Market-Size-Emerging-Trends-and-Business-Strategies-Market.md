A projector screen is a specially crafted surface used to showcase projected images or videos from a video projector. It acts as a canvas, allowing viewers to enjoy a clear and magnified image. Projector screens are available in various types, such as fixed-frame screens, motorized screens, portable screens, and pull-down screens.

The main objective of a projector screen is to optimize the quality of the projected content. Unlike projecting onto a wall or other flat surfaces, which may result in uneven or distorted images, projector screens are meticulously designed to uniformly reflect light, ensuring a consistent and vivid image.

Typically, projector screens have a white or off-white surface, as this color provides a neutral backdrop that doesn’t alter the projected colors. The material of the screen is carefully chosen to enhance image brightness, contrast, and viewing angles.
