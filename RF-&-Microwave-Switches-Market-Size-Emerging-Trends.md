An RF switch or microwave switch is a device to route high frequency signals through transmission paths. RF (radio frequency) and microwave switches are used extensively in microwave test systems for signal routing between instruments and devices under test (DUT). Incorporating a switch into a switch matrix system enables you to route signals from multiple instruments to single or multiple DUTs. This allows multiple tests to be performed with the same setup, eliminating the need for frequent connects and disconnects. The entire testing process can be automated, increasing the throughput in high-volume production environments.

RF (Radio Frequency) and microwave switches represent electronic components created with the purpose of managing the routing and regulation of RF and microwave signals within communication, radar, and other systems operating at high frequencies. These switches serve the role of guiding signals from one pathway to another, enabling or disabling specific routes for signals, and overseeing the intricate interconnections within intricate RF and microwave circuits.

At their core, the main function of RF and microwave switches revolves around establishing or severing electrical connections among distinct ports, essentially acting as input and output terminals for signals. These switches find utility in diverse scenarios, such as the selection of varying antennas, directing signals to different devices, segregating components, governing signal pathways in testing and measurement setups, and much more.
