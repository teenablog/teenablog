Recycled ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a type of thermoplastic polymer that is repurposed from discarded products, including electronic devices, automotive parts, and various consumer goods. The recycling process involves collecting, cleaning, shredding, and reprocessing ABS materials to create new, sustainable products. Recycled ABS retains most of the desirable properties of virgin ABS, such as durability, impact resistance, and ease of processing, making it a preferred material in multiple industries, including automotive, electronics, and consumer goods manufacturing.
