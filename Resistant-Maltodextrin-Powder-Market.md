Market Size

Resistant Maltodextrin Powder, also known as soluble corn fiber, is a type of dietary fiber derived from corn starch. Through a specialized enzymatic process, its molecular structure is modified to resist digestion in the small intestine. This allows it to pass through to the large intestine, where it undergoes fermentation by beneficial gut bacteria, producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and other metabolites that support digestive health. Resistant maltodextrin is widely used in functional foods, beverages, dietary supplements, and pharmaceuticals due to its prebiotic properties and ability to enhance digestive wellness without significantly impacting taste or texture.
