Key factors contributing to this growth include the growing number of people seeking to improve their digestion, the rise in health-conscious consumers, and the increasing demand for plant-based and gluten-free food products. These trends align with the broader wellness movement, which places emphasis on natural and functional ingredients that benefit overall health.

Market Overview

Resistant Tapioca Starch (RTS) is a specialized type of starch derived from tapioca, a starch obtained from the root of the cassava plant. Unlike regular tapioca starch, resistant tapioca starch is less digestible in the small intestine, which allows it to travel to the large intestine intact, where it serves as a prebiotic fiber. This characteristic makes it a valuable addition to the diet, particularly for those seeking to improve gut health. Resistant starches like RTS offer multiple health benefits, including the enhancement of gut microbiota, improved bowel function, and increased feelings of fullness, which may aid in weight management.

As a food ingredient, RTS is gaining popularity due to its potential health benefits, making it a key player in the functional foods and dietary supplements markets. RTS is used in various applications, including food products such as baked goods, pasta, and snacks, as well as in beverages and nutritional supplements.
