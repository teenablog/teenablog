Rigid bulk packaging refers to the use of sturdy, durable containers designed to store and transport large volumes of goods. These packaging solutions are engineered to provide maximum protection against physical damage, contamination, and environmental factors. Common examples of rigid bulk packaging include drums, intermediate bulk containers (IBCs), pails, and bulk boxes. They are extensively used in industries such as chemicals, food & beverages, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture, where the safe handling of products is crucial.
