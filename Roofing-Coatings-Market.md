This steady growth is driven by increased construction activities, rising concerns for energy efficiency, and the need for sustainable roofing solutions.

Market Overview

Roof coatings are protective layers applied to roof surfaces to extend their longevity, enhance durability, and improve energy efficiency. These coatings are used on various roof assemblies, including built-up roofing (BUR), metal, modified bitumen, single-ply membranes, and spray polyurethane foam (SPF). Designed to resist environmental damage, UV exposure, and weathering, roof coatings play a crucial role in maintaining roof integrity and reducing maintenance costs.
