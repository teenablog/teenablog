The Global Semiconductor Abatement Systems Market was valued at US$ 849.9 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 1691.9 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 10.3% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

The semiconductor industry uses gases that are toxic, flammable and even harmful for the environment, but also for humans. For example, in the production of microchips. According to national legislation, these gases have to be abated. This means that they are reduced below the respective threshold limit value (TLV). Different gases require different treatment technologies, such as thermal, wet or even a combination of both technologies. The process exhaust gases can then be released into the atmosphere, without harming nature, for a greener world.

Semiconductor abatement systems are specialized equipment and technologies employed in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Their purpose is to effectively manage and eliminate hazardous gases and particles that arise during the fabrication processes.

Semiconductor manufacturing involves a range of chemical procedures, such as etching, deposition, and cleaning, which can release potentially harmful gases and particulates into the atmosphere. If left uncontrolled, these emissions can pose risks to both human health and the environment.

To address this concern, abatement systems are designed to capture, treat, and remove these hazardous substances from the manufacturing environment. They utilize a combination of physical, chemical, and sometimes biological processes to either eliminate or neutralize the pollutants before they are released into the air.

Semiconductor abatement systems commonly target pollutants like volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hazardous gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3), as well as particulate matter. The components of these systems typically include exhaust hoods or enclosures, gas scrubbers, chemical filters, thermal oxidizers, and other treatment mechanisms. The specific configuration depends on the particular pollutants that need to be addressed.

By implementing semiconductor abatement systems, semiconductor manufacturers can ensure compliance with environmental regulations, safeguard the well-being of their workers, and minimize the environmental impact of their operations. These systems play a vital role in upholding sustainable and responsible practices in semiconductor production
