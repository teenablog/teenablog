Semiconductor test probe is a high-end precision electronic component, which is mainly used in the semiconductor testing process to test the conduction, current, function, aging and other performance indicators of the chip by connecting to the testing machine. Semiconductor test probes are mainly used for semiconductor chip design verification, wafer testing, and finished product testing mitigation. They are the core components that connect chips, wafers and testing equipment for signal transmission, and play an important role in the quality control of semiconductor products.

Semiconductor test probes are small devices used in the testing of semiconductor components, such as integrated circuits and transistors. These probes typically consist of a small metal needle or wire that is used to make contact with specific points on the semiconductor device being tested. The probe is connected to testing equipment that measures various electrical properties of the device, such as resistance, capacitance, and current flow. Semiconductor test probes are critical tools in the manufacturing and quality control of semiconductor components, as they allow engineers to verify that each component meets specific performance and reliability requirements.
