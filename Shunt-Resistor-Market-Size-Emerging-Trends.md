A shunt (shunt resistor or ammeter shunt) is a high precision resistor that can be used to measure the current flowing through a circuit. An ammeter shunt is a very low resistance connection between two points in a circuit that forms an alternate path for a portion of the current.

A shunt resistor is an electrical component that is used to measure the current flowing through a circuit. It is a low resistance resistor that is placed in parallel with a device or circuit under test, allowing a small portion of the current to flow through the shunt resistor. By measuring the voltage drop across the shunt resistor, the current flowing through the circuit can be accurately calculated using Ohm’s law. Shunt resistors are commonly used in applications such as power supplies, battery management systems, and motor control circuits.
