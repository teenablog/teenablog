Silicon Carbide (SiC) Power MOSFETs, also known as SiC MOSFETs, are a type of power semiconductor device used for switching and controlling electrical power in various applications. They are an evolution of traditional MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) but are made from silicon carbide instead of silicon, which gives them several advantages in high-power and high-frequency applications.

Silicon carbide MOSFETs have the characteristics of low on-resistance and small switching losses, which can reduce device losses and improve system efficiency, and are more suitable for high-frequency circuits. It is widely used in the fields of new energy vehicle motor controller, vehicle power supply, solar inverter, charging pile, UPS, PFC power supply and other fields.
