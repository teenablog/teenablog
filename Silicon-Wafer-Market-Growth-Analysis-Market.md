key trends in the silicon wafer market:



Growth: The silicon wafer market is growing steadily at around 5-7% per year, driven by increasing demand for semiconductors from industries like electronics, automotive, IoT, etc.
Wafer size: There is a trend toward larger wafer sizes like 300mm and 450mm to improve economies of scale. However, 200mm wafers still account for a significant portion of total production.
Technology nodes: Finer semiconductor technology nodes below 10nm are driving higher wafer purity requirements. This increases manufacturing complexity and costs.
Foundry share: Independent foundries now account for over half of all wafer fabrication. Leading foundries include TSMC, GlobalFoundries, SMIC, UMC, etc.
Regional shifts: Asia, led by Taiwan, South Korea and China, now dominates global wafer fabrication capacity. Their share is growing as fabs are built closer to large consumer markets.
Materials: New substrate materials like silicon carbide and gallium nitride are gaining ground for specialized applications that need better performance than silicon.
Shortages: The pandemic created supply chain disruptions and capacity bottlenecks, leading to silicon wafer shortages and higher prices in 2021-2022.
Sustainability: Efforts to reduce wafer manufacturing waste and transition to renewable energy are growing to improve environmental footprint.
