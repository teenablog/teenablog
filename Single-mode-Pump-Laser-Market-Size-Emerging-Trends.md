The single-mode pump laser is a high-stability light specially designed for pumping applications. The core of single-mode laser is relatively thin, the beam quality is better, the energy distribution is Gaussian, and the middle energy density is the highest.

A single-mode pump laser is a type of laser that emits a single-mode optical fiber-coupled output beam with a narrow spectral width. This type of laser is commonly used as a pump source for fiber amplifiers and lasers in applications such as telecommunications, spectroscopy, and sensing. The output beam of a single-mode pump laser typically has a Gaussian intensity profile and a high spatial coherence, which makes it ideal for coupling into single-mode optical fibers with minimal loss and mode mixing. The use of single-mode pump lasers can help improve the performance, efficiency, and reliability of fiber-based optical systems.
