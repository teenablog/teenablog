AC Linear Power Supplies:
AC linear power supplies are designed to accept an alternating current voltage as their input. Typically, they take in standard AC mains voltage, which could be 120V or 230V, depending on the location. These power supplies can generate both AC and DC output voltages, depending on their configuration. AC outputs are often used in applications like testing and calibration.

DC Linear Power Supplies:
DC linear power supplies, on the other hand, typically take an AC input voltage and convert it into a stable DC (Direct Current) output voltage. The input voltage can vary based on the specific design but often hinges on standard AC mains voltage.
