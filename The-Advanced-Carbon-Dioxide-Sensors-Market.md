Advanced carbon dioxide (CO2) sensors refer to next-generation sensors used for measuring the concentration of CO2 in air, water and plasma. Some of the commonly used sensors include electrochemical, photoionizing detectors (PID), catalytic, infrared, laser and holographic. They are used in terrariums and automobile exhausts and air quality measurement and food spoilage detection systems as they can automatically adjust in response to the changes in temperature, humidity and altitude. As a result, these sensors are widely used for maintaining indoor air quality and minimizing energy consumption and CO2 levels in closed spaces.
