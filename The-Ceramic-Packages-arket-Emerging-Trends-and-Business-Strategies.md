Ceramic packages are containers made from ceramic materials that are used to encase and protect electronic components such as microchips, sensors, and other similar devices. These packages provide a protective shield against environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, and mechanical stresses, and they also help to dissipate heat generated by the components. Ceramic packages are widely used in industries such as telecommunications, aerospace, automotive, and medical devices due to their excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties. They are preferred over other materials due to their high strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion and wear.
