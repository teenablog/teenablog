The global Chip Handler in Semiconductor market was valued at US$ 911.6 million in 2022 and is projected to reach US$ 1264.5 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.

A chip handler is a specialized machine or equipment utilized in the semiconductor industry for the handling, transportation, and processing of individual semiconductor chips or integrated circuits (ICs). It plays a crucial role in the complete semiconductor manufacturing and testing process.

The primary purpose of chip handlers is to create a controlled and secure environment for the delicate and sensitive semiconductor chips. They are equipped with mechanisms that prevent electrostatic discharge (ESD), regulate temperature and humidity levels, and ensure precise alignment and placement of the chips.

Chip Handler in Semiconductors are primarily used to for sorting, testing and transferring chips with the simple electrical interface diagram: ATE ITA DUT (package) Handler. And these machines are capable of processing thousands of chips in an hour. Normally, packaged parts use a handler to place the device on a customized interface board, then IC chip handler transfers finished chips to the inspection equipment for final visual and electrical performance test and then sort the chips into good, bad or other bins based on test results. Note: ATE: Automatic Test Equipment; ITA: Interface Test Adapter; DUT: Device Under Test.

In the semiconductor manufacturing process, chip handlers play a crucial role in various stages, which include:

Testing: Chip handlers are employed to perform tests on chips to identify any defects. This involves subjecting the chips to a series of electrical tests to assess their functionality and performance.

Sorting: Chip handlers are utilized for categorizing chips into different groups, such as those that are deemed good, bad, or potentially reworkable. This classification is typically based on the results obtained from the testing process.

Transferring: Chip handlers are responsible for the safe and precise transfer of chips from one machine to another. This transfer is commonly performed to move the chips from the testing machine to the packaging machine, ensuring a smooth transition between manufacturing steps.

In essence, chip handlers facilitate testing, sorting, and transferring operations within the semiconductor manufacturing process, contributing to the overall efficiency and quality control of chip production.
