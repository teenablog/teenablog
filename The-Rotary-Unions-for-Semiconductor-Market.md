A rotary union or swivel joint is a mechanism used to transfer fluid (under pressure or vacuum) from a stationary inlet to a rotating outlet, preserving and isolating the fluid connection. Also referred to as rotary joints, rotary couplings, fluid swivels or swivel joints; rotary unions are engineered to endure a large range of temperatures, pressures and speeds for a variety of conditions and environments. Rotary unions typically function by connecting to an input and securing onto another mechanism while allowing a moving connection to be preserved.

Rotary unions are an important component used in the semiconductor industry for various applications, including wafer processing, cooling systems, and vacuum applications. The rotary unions help to transfer fluids or gases from a stationary supply pipe to a rotating component, without causing any leakage or contamination.

The market for rotary unions in the semiconductor industry is expected to grow significantly in the coming years due to the increasing demand for semiconductors and the need for advanced processing techniques. The growing demand for smartphones, tablets, and other electronic devices is driving the demand for semiconductors, which in turn is boosting the demand for rotary unions.
