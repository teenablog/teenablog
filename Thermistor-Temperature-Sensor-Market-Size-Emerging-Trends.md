A thermistor temperature sensor is an electronic component that measures temperature by utilizing the resistance properties of a thermistor. A thermistor is a type of resistor whose electrical resistance varies with temperature. These sensors are commonly used in various applications to monitor and control temperature. They provide a simple and cost-effective way to measure temperature changes and are used in devices such as thermostats, automotive temperature sensors, and electronic circuits that require temperature compensation. The resistance of a thermistor decreases as the temperature increases (negative temperature coefficient or NTC thermistor) or increases as the temperature rises (positive temperature coefficient or PTC thermistor), depending on the type of thermistor used.
