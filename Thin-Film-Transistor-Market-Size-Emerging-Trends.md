A thin film transistor (TFT) is a distinct class of field-effect transistor (FET) produced by depositing thin-films of an active semi-conductor layer along with the dielectric layer & metallic connections over a supporting substrate. It is also a type of flat-panel LCD display screen, in which each pixel is controlled by one to four transistors. This transistor could be made using an extensive variety of semi-conductor materials where a popular material is silicon. Transistors are embedded inside the panel itself, lessening crosstalk between pixels & improving image stability. The primary application of thin film transistors is within TFT LCDs, an implementation of liquid crystal display technology.

A Thin Film Transistor (TFT) is a crucial semiconductor device widely used in electronics, especially in displays like LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays) and OLEDs (Organic Light Emitting Diodes). It plays a vital role in controlling individual pixels on modern flat-panel screens.

The TFT is a unique kind of field-effect transistor (FET) composed of a thin layer of semiconductor material, usually amorphous silicon or polysilicon, that gets deposited on a substrate like glass or plastic. This thin film design enables a compact and efficient structure, making it ideal for incorporation into large-scale integrated circuits.
