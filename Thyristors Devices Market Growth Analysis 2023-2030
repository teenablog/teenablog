Functioning akin to switches, thyristors adeptly manage substantial power and voltage thresholds. Notably, they showcase an exclusive trait termed "latching." This attribute implies that following activation through a trigger signal, thyristors persist in their conductive state until the current coursing through them dwindles beneath a specific limit. This latching behavior renders thyristors particularly suitable for scenarios demanding the retention of their operational state even upon removal of the initiating signal.



Prevalently encountered in the landscape of thyristors is the silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR), primarily tasked with supervising both DC and AC currents. Additionally, the triode for alternating current (TRIAC) ranks among widely embraced thyristors, meticulously tailored to cater to AC-based requisites. Furthermore, GTO (Gate Turn-Off) thyristors, a distinct variant, can be deactivated by means of a control signal, extending heightened precision compared to conventional thyristors.



North American market for Thyristors Devices is estimated to increase from $ 115.47 million in 2023 to reach $ 167.93 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 6.44% during the forecast period of 2023 through 2029.



Asia-Pacific market for Thyristors Devices is estimated to increase from $ 434.73 million in 2023 to reach $ 722.99 million by 2029, at a CAGR of 8.85% during the forecast period of 2023 through 2029.
