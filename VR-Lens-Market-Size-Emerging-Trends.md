VR lens has a unique optical design specially engineered for measuring near-eye displays (NEDs), such as those integrated into virtual (VR) headsets. The lens design simulates the size, position, and field of view of the human eye. Unlike alternative lens options, where the aperture is located inside the lens, the aperture of the VR lens is located on the front of the lens, enabling positioning of the imaging systems entrance pupil within NED headsets to view head-mounted displays (HMDs) at the same location as the human eye.

VR Lens, also known as Virtual Reality Lens, refers to the optical components utilized in virtual reality (VR) headsets and devices. These lenses play a crucial role in the VR experience by directly projecting the virtual content into the user’s eyes, creating the immersive 3D environment that VR is renowned for.

The main objective of VR lenses is to deliver a wide field of view (FOV) and distortion correction, ensuring that the virtual content appears realistic and seamless to the user. Their function involves magnifying and bending the light from the display screen, enabling the user to perceive the virtual world as if they were physically present within it.
