Wafer bonding equipment is a type of semiconductor processing equipment used to bond two or more wafers together to form a single structure. This process is typically used to create complex semiconductor devices that require multiple layers or different materials.

Wafer bonding can be achieved through various techniques, including thermal compression bonding, adhesive bonding, and direct bonding. The choice of bonding technique depends on the materials being bonded, the required bonding strength, and the desired level of precision.

The equipment used for wafer bonding typically includes a bonding chamber or tool, which provides a controlled environment for the bonding process. The bonding surfaces of the wafers are carefully cleaned and prepared to ensure a strong and uniform bond. The wafers are then aligned and brought into contact with each other under controlled pressure and temperature conditions.

Wafer bonding equipment is commonly used in the manufacturing of advanced semiconductor devices such as micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS), power devices, and sensors. The bonding process enables the creation of highly integrated devices with multiple functionalities and improved performance characteristics.
