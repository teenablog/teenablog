The global White Box Switches market was valued at US$ 2,243 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach US$ 5,743.8 million by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 14.06% during the forecast period 2023-2029.



White Box Switches refer to networking switches that are produced by original design manufacturers (ODMs) or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) without a specific, proprietary brand. These switches are characterized by their openness, allowing users to run different network operating systems (NOS) on the hardware. The term "white box" reflects the absence of a pre-installed branded network operating system, giving users the flexibility to choose and deploy the software that best suits their specific requirements.
